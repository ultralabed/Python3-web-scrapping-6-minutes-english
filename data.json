I'm Catherine\u2026<span><br/></span></p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I'm Neil.<span><br/></span></p>, <p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>So, Neil, do you notice anything different about me today?<span><br/></span></p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Have you done your hair differently?<span><br/></span></p>, <p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>No.<span><br/></span></p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Is that a new outfit?<span><br/></span></p>, <p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Honestly, Neil!<span><br/></span></p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I give up. I don't know what's different about you.<span><br/></span></p>, <p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>OK. Well, maybe by the end of the show you'll have figured it out. Anyway, today we're discussing memory and whether we can remember things accurately. So are you ready to answer today's quiz question, Neil?<span><br/></span></p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I am.<span><br/></span></p>, <p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>OK. So in which part of the brain is there an area dedicated to remembering faces? Is it\u2026<br/>a) the temporal lobe?<br/>b) the hypothalamus?<br/>or c) the cerebellum?<span><br/></span></p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, I have no idea. But I'll say a) the temporal lobe.<br/><strong><br/> Catherine<br/></strong>OK and we'll find out whether you chose the correct answer later on in the show. But let's talk more about how our memories can play tricks on us. We tend to think of memory as being like a video recorder that we can replay and recall again and again as it originally occurred. But memory doesn't work like that. It's a reconstructive process.<span><br/></span></p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>A reconstructive process?<span><br/></span></p>, <p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Yes. We <strong>reconstruct</strong>\u00a0- or rebuild - memories, and during this process, they may be <strong>distorted</strong> \u2013 or changed \u2013 for different reasons. Let's listen to Tim Valentine, retired professor of psychology at Goldsmith's College at the University of London, talking about this.<span><br/></span></p>, <p><strong>INSERT<br/> Tim Valentine, retired professor of psychology at Goldsmith's College, University of London <br/></strong>From all those TV dramas you've watched you'll be familiar with the forensic scenes of crimes officers wearing their paper suits and covering their shoes and their hair to make sure they don't introduce their DNA or physical traces onto the crime scene. So that in the same way anybody who has any interaction with a witness needs to make sure that they don't distort their memory.<span><br/></span></p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So crime officers wear protective clothing at crime scenes so they don't contaminate it with their DNA.<span><br/></span></p>, <p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>That's right. A <strong>crime scene</strong> is a place where a crime was committed. And <strong>contaminated</strong> means 'made impure through contact with an outside source'. So for example, if an officer touches something without gloves on, they introduce new information. And once this has happened, you can't get back to the original information.<span><br/></span></p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Now, Tim Valentine says that when police officers talk to the witness of a crime, they might also introduce new information. And this could change the witness's memory of what happened.<span><br/></span></p>, <p><strong>Catherine<br/> </strong>And it isn't only police questioning that can distort memory. Other factors such as stress can affect your ability to recall events accurately. For example, if you're being held at knifepoint you are likely to be concentrating on the weapon rather than on your attacker's face. And <strong>at knifepoint </strong>means 'under threat of being stabbed'.<span><br/></span></p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So why do we place so much importance on eyewitness accounts?<br/><br/><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Eyewitness accounts can sound very convincing in court \u2013 but in fact according to research, they are often unreliable. <span>Karen Newirth, senior attorney at the Innocence Project in New York,</span> explains this further.<span><br/></span></p>, <p><strong><span>INSERT<br/></span></strong><strong><span>Karen Newirth, senior attorney at the Innocence Project, New York<br/></span></strong><span>First, I think it's sort of natural for people to want to believe that memory can be accurate. It's very disconcerting to think that we're going through life relying on our memories and then to learn how mistaken they can be - and how frequently. Second is that the testimony of eyewitnesses has become a very expected piece of criminal trial so jurors sort of anticipate it, look for it, and tend to believe it.</span><span><br/></span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>So we like to trust in our ability to remember things accurately. And it's disconcerting to learn that memory is frequently inaccurate. And <strong>disconcerting</strong></span><span> means\u2026</span><span><br/></span></p>, <p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>\u2026it means 'confusing and a bit upsetting'.<span><br/></span></p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Karen Newirth also says that people expect eyewitness<strong> testimony </strong>\u2013 or spoken statements \u2013 in court. Do you think that's true, Catherine?<span><br/></span></p>, <p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Yes \u2013 and it's the most commonly used evidence brought against criminal defendants in court, even though they are often inaccurate.<span><br/></span></p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Are there any ways to improve accuracy?<span><br/></span></p>, <p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>Yes, there are. For example, in a police line-up you can prevent eyewitnesses receiving information from the officer giving instructions, which might influence their response.<span><br/></span></p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, I see. Well, you didn't give anything away when you asked what was different about your appearance at the beginning of the show.<span><br/></span></p>, <p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Yes, that's true, Neil. But I can now reveal to you that... I'm wearing glasses, Neil. I've lost my contact lenses!<span><br/></span></p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I don't know how I missed that. Because actually you do look, well, completely different with glasses.<span><br/></span></p>, <p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Just a bit, yes. So, now we're running out of time, so let's move onto the answer to today's quiz question. Remember I asked: in which part of the brain is there an area dedicated to recognizing faces? Is it\u2026<br/>a) the temporal lobe?<br/>b) the hypothalamus?<br/>or c) the cerebellum?<span><br/></span></p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I said a) the temporal lobe. Was I right?<span><br/></span></p>, <p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>You were indeed, Neil! Very well done, it was the correct answer!<span><br/></span></p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes!<span><br/></span></p>, <p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>The main part of the brain dedicated to recognising faces \u2013 called the Fusiform Face Area \u2013 is positioned in the temporal lobe, which can be found roughly in the area just behind your ears.<span><br/></span></p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>Fascinating! Now, here are the words we learned today\u2026<br/>reconstruct<br/>distorted<br/>crime scene<br/>contaminated<br/>at knifepoint<br/>disconcerting<br/>testimony<span><br/></span></p>, <p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And that bring us to the end of today's 6 Minute English.

I'm Catherine\u2026</span><span><br/></span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And I'm Neil. Do you know, Catherine, someone actually talked to me on the underground this morning!</span><span><br/></span></p>, <p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>No, really?</span><strong><span>\u00a0</span></strong></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yeah.</span><span><br/></span></p>, <p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Wow! I should perhaps point out that talking to someone you don't know on the Tube is quite unusual behaviour in London! So, Neil, what did they say?<br/><br/></span><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, they said what a lovely day it was, great to see the sun shining in London \u2013 something along those lines. But it was actually nice to chat instead of sitting there with a frown on my face, fiddling with my phone.</span><span><br/></span></p>, <p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Which is what you probably always do to pass the time on public transport, Neil.</span><span><br/></span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, it is - me and thousands of others. But it got me thinking\u2026 if it makes me feel better to talk to people on the way to work, why don't I \u2013 and other commuters in the city \u2013 do it more often?</span><span><br/></span></p>, <p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Well, that's a good question, Neil, and maybe we'll find some answers in the show, because today we're talking about why cities make us so rude.\u00a0 </span><span>And I have a question for you: when we have a positive interaction with somebody, our body releases a chemical. But what's the name of this chemical? Is it\u2026<br/></span><span>a) melatonin?<br/></span><span>b) oxytocin?<br/></span><span>Or c) thyroxin?</span><span><br/></span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>I don't know, but I'm going to say a) melatonin.</span><span><br/></span></p>, <p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Well, we'll see if you were right or not later on in the show. But did you know, Neil, that an organisation called 'Talk to me London' has created these 'Tubechat' badges that you can wear to show that you're happy to talk to a stranger. Maybe you should get one!\u00a0<br/></span><strong><br/><span> Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yeah, maybe I should. But the thing is, people in big cities are often scared to start a conversation with a stranger because, well, you don't know what might happen.\u00a0</span><span><br/></span></p>, <p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>That's true. Now, let's listen to Dr Elle Boag, a social psychologist at Birmingham City University here in the UK. She agrees that people can view cities as threatening places.\u00a0</span><span><br/></span></p>, <p><strong><span>INSERT<br/></span><span> </span></strong><strong><span>Dr Elle Boag, social psychologist, Birmingham City University in the UK<br/></span></strong><span>When we step off the metro or onto a crowded city street our brain becomes hyper vigilant to the perception of threats around us \u2013 we're just one small person in a very large set of other people, in a large body of people. This then leads to behaviours that are insular and defensive. We're persistently looking for potential threats around us, and this then makes us not give eye contact, this will reduce the likelihood that anybody will say hello. It's a protective mechanism by which we can survive our journey to whence we're going, which makes us all sound really really rude to one other.</span><span><br/></span></p>, <p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Dr Elle Boag there. And <strong>hyper vigilance</strong></span><span> means being extremely watchful of what's going on around you. People can behave unpredictably, and like Dr Boag says, you're just one person in a crowd of others and you just don't know who might be dangerous.<br/><br/></span><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yeah, I see what you mean. And the fact we are constantly on the lookout for potential threats, well, it affects our behaviour.</span><span><br/></span></p>, <p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>That's right. And as a protective mechanism we avoid speaking to or making eye contact with other people. So we become <strong>insular</strong></span><span> \u2013 which means inward looking.\u00a0</span><span><br/></span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>It sounds awful! But actually, I know people who moved to London in order to be anonymous \u2013 to blend in with the crowd \u2013 and not have to talk to people!</span><span><br/></span></p>, <p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Well, if you grow up in a small town, it can feel <strong>claustrophobic</strong></span><span> \u2013 which means not having enough space to feel comfortable. You know, you can't do anything without the whole community knowing about it. You may have nosey neighbours.</span><span><br/></span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And a <strong>nosey</strong></span><span> person shows too much interest in other people's business.\u00a0</span><span><br/></span></p>, <p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Now, it's good to point out that people living in cities have stuff to do. And it's not necessarily rudeness that stops people from chatting \u2013 it's about efficiency \u2013 getting to work on time, getting things done. Let's hear from Thomas Farley, writer and broadcaster, and expert on manners, for more on this.\u00a0</span><span><br/></span></p>, <p><strong><span>INSERT<br/></span><span> </span></strong><strong><span>Thomas Farley, writer and broadcaster<br/></span></strong><span>The cost of living in cities is higher, the success quotient is higher, it's a place where you hustle to survive, and if you are not hustling, and I mean that literally and figuratively, you are not able to survive and thrive. So we often don't have much time for chitchat. I think we just all need to be mindful that it's not a deliberate disregard or somebody trying to be rude on purpose \u2013 it's simply that people have a destination to be.</span><span><br/></span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>So what does Thomas Farley mean by success quotient, Catherine?</span><span><br/></span></p>, <p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span><strong>Success quotient</strong> means your ability to be successful in work, relative to the average person, and Thomas Farley is saying that in cities people have higher success quotients.</span><span><br/></span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Cities are also competitive places so people have to hustle to survive. Do we hustle, Catherine?</span><span><br/></span></p>, <p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>I don't think we hustle, Neil. <strong>Hustle</strong></span><span> means to work aggressively to make money.\u00a0</span><span><br/></span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>We do have plenty of time for chitchat, though. And <strong>chitchat</strong></span><span>, by the way, means unimportant conversation. That's what we do!</span><span><br/></span></p>, <p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>What we do isn't chitchat, Neil! It's highly informative and instructional! Now, I think it must be time to hear the answer to today's quiz. Do you remember, I asked: when we have a positive interaction with someone, our body releases a chemical. What's the name of this chemical? Is it\u2026<br/><br/></span><span>a) melatonin?<br/></span><span>b) oxytocin?<br/></span><span>Or c) thyroxin?</span></p>, <p><span> </span><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And it's a) melatonin \u2013 I'm absolutely sure.</span></p>, <p><span> </span><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Sorry! The correct answer is b) oxytocin \u2013 a hormone commonly known as the 'love drug'. It reduces fear, increases trust between people, and evokes feelings of contentment. </span></p>, <p><span> </span><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Now, here are the words we learned today:<br/></span><span>hyper vigilance<br/></span><span>insular<br/></span><span>claustrophobic<br/></span><span>nosey<br/></span><span>quotient<br/></span><span>hustle<br/></span><span>chitchat</span></p>, <p><span> </span><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>That's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

Do you realise, Catherine, that we are related to each other?</span><span><br/></span></p>, <p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Don't be silly, Neil. I think I'd know if you were in my family.</span><span><br/></span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, we'll talk more about that later in the show, but I should say at this point that today we're discussing <strong>genealogy</strong></span><span> \u2013 or the study of family history. And I think it's pretty fascinating stuff. Do you ever watch the TV programme </span><em><span>Who do you think you are, </span></em><span>Catherine? You know, where celebrities find out about their family history?</span><span><br/></span></p>, <p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Yeah, I've seen a couple of them. For example, one celebrity \u2013 who was very proud of his working class London <strong>roots</strong></span><span> \u2013 or origins \u2013 discovered that he's actually a direct descendent of an English king!</span><span><br/></span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, that's quite a discovery! The thing is though, Catherine, what if there isn't anything exciting in your family history \u2013 no mysteries, no skeletons in the closet\u2026</span><span><br/></span></p>, <p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Well, I reckon if you go back far enough Neil, there's always something exciting or unexpected in anybody's family history. And <strong>skeletons in the closet</strong></span><span> by the way, means secrets! Now, I think it's time for today's quiz question. Researching family history often involves reading old documents such as birth, marriage and death certificates, and these can be difficult to </span><strong><span>decipher</span></strong><span> \u2013 or understand. So what's the name for the study of ancient handwriting? Is it\u2026<br/></span><span>a) Scriptography?<br/></span><span>b) Palaeography?<br/></span><span>Or c) Scribology?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, it must be a) Scriptography.</span><span><br/></span></p>, <p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And we'll see if you're right or not later on in the show. Now, why do you think most people look into their genealogy, Neil? Is it just curiosity?\u00a0</span><span><br/></span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, Catherine, we all love a good mystery story \u2013 especially if it's connected with our own family. And these days, it's easy to do research online because many old paper documents have been digitised and are available online.</span><span><br/></span></p>, <p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>BBC presenter Mike Williams investigated his own family history. And here, he's talking about his great-grandfather's story. And if you listen carefully you can hear him rustling the real paper documents!</span><span><br/></span></p>, <p><strong>INSERT<br/> </strong><strong>Mike Williams, BBC presenter<br/></strong>The Williamses are my father's side and on my mother's the Heino's \u2013 it's a name that we think comes from Finland. If I look at this document here \u2013 it's a copy of the census of England and Wales 1911 - you can see my grandfather, the son, and his father \u2013 the head of the household \u2013 Michael Heino, or Michel Heino, who, the family law has it, jumped ship and ended up in Liverpool.\u00a0</p>, <p><strong><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">Neil<br/></span></strong><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">What's a <strong>census</strong></span><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">, Catherine?</span><span data-mce-mark=\"1\"><br/></span></p>, <p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>It's an official count of people in a population. So Mike Williams's great grandfather appeared on the 1911 census for England and Wales but because of his surname the family think he might originally have come from Finland.</span><span><br/></span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span><span> </span></strong><span>The exciting event in Mike Williams' history \u2013 passed down through <strong>family lore</strong></span><span> \u2013 which means 'knowledge passed on from one generation to the next' \u2013 is that his great-grandfather </span><span>jumped ship</span><span>.<br/><br/></span><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Which means he left the ship he was working on without permission to do so.\u00a0</span><span><br/></span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And he started a new life in England. I suppose quite a few people have immigration stories in their family histories \u2013 sometimes without knowing it.\u00a0</span><span><br/></span></p>, <p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Actually that's something that many people are fascinated by \u2013 and has also become easier to investigate these days now companies offer to test the DNA in your saliva for as little as a hundred dollars.</span><span><br/></span></p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And then they come up with results saying you're related to Alexander the Great or Brad Pitt\u2026\u00a0Remember I said that we were related? Well, let's now listen to Else Churchill, from the Society of Genealogists here in London, who explains what I meant.</p>, <p><strong><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">INSERT<br/></span><span data-mce-mark=\"1\"> </span></strong><strong><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">Else Churchill, Society of Genealogists, London<br/></span></strong><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">There's what you might call the 'gateway ancestor' \u2013 and the idea of history and genealogy is that's normally somebody that is so well documented that their descendants are well known \u2013 in England it's something like Edward III. And we're all probably descended from Edward III. Is it nice to have royal ancestors? Well, millions of people are descended from Edward III, and so in that sense, that's where the connection might be. So the chances are an awful lot of people are distantly connected to each other.</span><span data-mce-mark=\"1\"><br/></span></p>, <p><strong><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">Catherine<br/></span></strong><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">Else Churchill says it's likely that millions of us are distantly related to a gateway ancestor like King Edward III of England. And that means that all those people related to Edward III are also distantly related to each other.

I'm Alice\u2026</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I'm Neil. So Alice, what's your ideal place to be?</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Curled up on the sofa with a good book in front of a log fire. Last night it was very cold.\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, for me, lying in a hammock under a palm tree on a tropical beach with a cool breeze. I don't like when it's too hot.\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Yes, true. Humans don't cope well with extremes of temperature but some species do. The subject of today's show is <strong>extremophiles</strong> \u2013 these are microorganisms that have adapted to live in what we would consider to be extreme conditions. For example, living in near boiling acidic water or frozen at the bottom of an Antarctic lake.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Those do sound like pretty extreme conditions.\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Yes. The thing is, what sounds <strong>hostile</strong> \u2013 or unfriendly \u2013 to us, are perfect environments for extremophiles and in fact they wouldn't survive without them. Now, are you tough enough to face up to today's quiz question, Neil?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I think so.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Alright then, here goes: which US National Park is home to <strong>geysers</strong> \u2013 or hot springs that shoot hot water and steam into the air \u2013 which have extremophiles living in them? Is it\u2026<br/>a) Grand Canyon?<br/>b) Death Valley National Park?<br/>Or c) Yellowstone?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>That's easy - it has to be c) Yellowstone.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>OK, well we'll find out if you got the answer right later on in the show. But, moving on, now, Neil, did you know that extremophiles belong to an entirely different group of living things to other animals and plants?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>No. I imagined extremophiles would be like insects, because insects are pretty tough, aren't they?</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Yes, that's true. But remember, extremophiles are <strong>microorganisms</strong> \u2013 they're really tiny. Let's listen to Ian Crawford, Professor of Planetary Science and Astrobiology at Birkbeck University of London. He tells us how in the 1970s a scientist called Carl Woese identified a new kingdom of living things that he called 'archaea' \u2013 meaning 'ancient ones'. The extremophiles belong to this group.</p>, <p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Ian Crawford, Professor of Planetary Science and Astrobiology at Birkbeck University of London<br/></strong>Well, the old tree of life idea basically talked about empires if you like, of plants, and animals, and things that we can see, essentially. We put a great deal of emphasis on large organisms and the traditional distinction in biology between botany and zoology. What it really did was say 'that's all wrong \u2013 there's really only three major groups in life: there's the archaea, the bacteria, and the eukaryotes, which is all of this complex life'; and so it kind of put humans into a small corner of the tree of life next to plants and whatever else. It kind of squashes us again after being the centre of the universe.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So <strong>botany</strong> is the study of plant life, and <strong>zoology</strong> is the study of animal life. But maybe you can explain 'archaea', and 'eukaryotes', Alice.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong><strong>Archaea</strong> are a group of single-celled microbes similar to bacteria but different to all other known types. <strong>Eukaryote</strong> is the scientific term for organisms with a much larger and more complex type of cell\u2013 and this group includes all animals, plants, and fungi.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>But why are archaea so important? Why do they need a whole biological domain to themselves, while we humans get squashed up in one domain with plants and fungi?</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well, Neil, it's likely they've have been living on our planet ever since the Earth became habitable \u2013 and that's billions of years. And they are still living and thriving in a whole range of different environments today.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And when something is <strong>thriving</strong> it means it's doing well! So tell us about where they live, Alice.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Some live in <strong>hydrothermal vents</strong> \u2013 holes in the ocean floor hundreds of metres down where there's lots of pressure and no sunlight. And mineral-rich superheated water is coming out of the Earth's crust and then flowing out through these holes.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I see\u2026 Well, what about cold-loving extremophiles?</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well, scientists have found them in hidden lakes trapped beneath ice sheets hundreds of metres thick in Antarctica. It takes days to drill through the ice to reach the water.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And how do they survive down there?</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well, these microbes have found a way of getting energy from certain minerals like iron and sulphur present in the water.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>That sounds clever for a microbe \u2013 how did they figure that out?</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>It isn't a question of cleverness - it's a question of adaptation. Extremophiles are extremely well adapted to their environment and they appeared on Earth much earlier than more complex life forms. Let's hear from Nick Lane, Reader in Evolutionary Biochemistry at University College London.</p>, <p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Nick Lane, Reader in Evolutionary Biochemistry at University College London<br/></strong>The origin of the Eukaryotic cell, it seems to have happened once, it took about 2 billion years before that happened. Then there was kind of a great leap forward at the cellular level, but another billion years went by before we see animals.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So, basically, the animal kingdom is much newer than the archaean kingdom.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Indeed. And now it's time for the answer to today's quiz question, Neil. I asked: which US National Park is home to geysers that have extremophiles living in them? Is it\u2026 a) Grand Canyon, b) Death Valley National Park or c) Yellowstone?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I said c) Yellowstone. I must be right.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Yes, Neil, you are right - it's Yellowstone National Park. Every year, scientists discover remarkable new microbes in Yellowstone's hot springs, with implications for medicine, agriculture and energy, as well as offering clues to the formation of the earliest life on Earth.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Very interesting. Now, here are the words we heard today:<br/>extremophiles<br/>hostile<br/>geysers<br/>microorganisms<br/>botany<br/>zoology<br/>archaea<br/>eukaryote<br/>thriving<br/>hydrothermal vents</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>And that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

He's cool and funny \u2013 and he can spin webs and jump off skyscrapers!<span><br/></span></p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well, my favourite superhero is Ms Marvel.<span><br/></span></p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I've never heard of her \u2013 and I\u2019m a bit on an expert on comic book superheroes.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well, a growing number of people from ethnic backgrounds are getting bored of all these white male superheroes they can\u2019t relate to. And they're hungry for characters a little <strong>closer to home</strong> \u2013 or relevant to their own lives.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So what's Ms Marvel's super power?</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>She's a <strong>shape shifter</strong> \u2013 which means she can change shape and become anything she wants. But she's also just Kamala Khan, an average teenager from New Jersey, who happens to be Asian and a Muslim.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>It sounds good. But I think it must be time for today's quiz question, Alice!</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/> </strong>OK, here it is. What is the name of the new character that replaces Tony Stark as Iron Man? Is it\u2026<br/>a) Miles Morales?<br/>b) Riri Williams?<br/>Or c) Jane Foster?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I'm going to say a) Miles Morales because he sounds like a man.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well, we'll find out later on the show whether you got the answer right or not. Now, I have another question. What are the rules for achieving superhero status? Superman is an alien, Ms Marvel has alien genes, and Spiderman and the Hulk are both <strong>contaminated</strong> \u2013 or poisoned \u2013 by radioactive substances that change their DNA.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>What about Batman and Iron Man? They're just ordinary guys with a lot of money who use technology to create superpowers for themselves.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Good point. There don't seem to be any <strong>hard-and-fast</strong> \u2013 or clear \u2013 rules. But these special powers \u2013 whether it's being able to fly, or change shape, or spin webs \u2013 they allow the characters to do good in the world. And that\u2019s a big theme across all comic books.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>That's true. But times have changed, and comic books these days often <strong>blur</strong> the line between right and wrong \u2013 making things unclear. Superheroes don\u2019t always do the right thing and struggle with everyday problems like you and me.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Let's hear more about imperfect superheroes from Jason Ditmer, professor of political geography at University College London.</p>, <p><strong>INSERT<br/> </strong><strong><span>Jason Ditmer, professor of political geography at University College London<br/></span></strong><span>They [Marvel Comics] imbued these characters with real human problems. So Peter Parker had just, was sort of\u2026 one problem after another. The Fantastic Four was a family and they bickered and fought and Reed and Sue were a couple, and then they got married, and that had, like, never happened in superhero comics. So these people had lives that others could relate to. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>So publishers \u2013 like Marvel Comics \u2013 <strong>imbued</strong></span><span> \u2013 or filled \u2013 their characters with human problems. I can't imagine a character like Captain America worrying about small things \u2013 or bickering with his wife!</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>And <strong>bickering</strong></span><span> means arguing about things that aren't important. Well, like you said earlier, times change, Neil. These days, the publishing houses want to attract a more </span><strong><span>diverse</span></strong><span> \u2013 or varied \u2013 readership: teenagers, women, ethnic minorities \u2013 who want superheroes they can relate to, facing issues from racial discrimination to bickering at home. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>I know that women are indeed interested in superheroes because they've been appearing in movies and on TV, but the world of comic books has always been a bit of a guy thing.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Well, it isn't. Women read them and in some places women work in them. In Japan for example, we have the <strong>manga</strong> \u2013 these are Japanese comic books for adults and children. And, guess what \u2013 there is a strong tradition of female illustrators there. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Really?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Yes. Let\u2019s move on now and listen to Dr Casey Brienza, Sociologist at City University in London, talking about manga.</span></p>, <p><strong>INSERT<br/> </strong><strong><span>Dr Casey Brienza, Sociologist at City University in London<br/></span></strong><span>One of the really interesting things about producing comics in Japan is that it's one of the few, kind of, autonomous careers that women can have. And so Japan has many, many female comic-book artists who write both for men, women, boys, and girls. And in the United States and in Britain female comic-book artists are far and away a minority.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>Dr Casey Brienza there. So she says female comic-book artists are common in Japan but are a minority in the US and the UK.<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>It's particularly interesting that being an artist is an <strong>autonomous</strong> career \u2013 meaning you have the freedom to make your own decisions - and apparently this is not common for women in Japan.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And do you know who draws Ms Marvel? Is it a woman?</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>No. Ms Marvel is drawn by a man \u2013 the Canadian comic book artist Adrian Alphona. But we are running out of time so let's go to today's quiz question. I asked you: what's the name of the new character that replaces Tony Stark as Iron Man? Is it\u2026<br/>a) Miles Morales?<br/>b) Riri Williams?<br/>Or c) Jane Foster?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I said Miles Morales.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>And you were\u2026 wrong, Neil. I'm sorry. The answer is Riri Williams. Marvel Comics has recently diversified its characters to look more like the world we know today, including the addition of female African-American college student Riri Williams as Iron Man. Marvel has also given Thor's hammer to a woman, introduced a black, Hispanic Spider-Man called Miles Morales and created Kamala Khan, a Muslim superhero otherwise known as Ms Marvel.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Very interesting.

I'm Alice\u2026</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I'm Neil. What do you think about autonomous cars, Alice?</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>An <strong>autonomous</strong> \u2013 or independent and driverless \u2013 car is a vehicle that is capable of sensing its environment and navigating without human input. I think they're a great idea.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And <strong>navigate</strong> means' to find the way to get to a place'. I'm not sure I would trust a computer to drive me. It might go wrong and crash into a wall.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Maybe, but actually most car accidents involve an element of human error, and <strong>human error</strong> means 'the mistakes we make because we're human'. For example, people who are behind the wheel while tired or drunk \u2013 or distracted.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong><strong>Behind the wheel:</strong>\u00a0in other words, in control of a car. Yes, I often see people talking on their mobile phones \u2013 or texting \u2013 instead of looking at the road.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>They are being irresponsible drivers, Neil. Driving is the subject of today's show. I have a question for you. On average, how many people around the world die each day from road accidents? Is it\u2026<br/><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">a</span>) 300?<br/>b) 3,000?<br/>Or c) 30,000?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I'm going to say b) 3,000.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well, we'll see if you were right or not later on in the show. Are you a petrol head, Neil?<span><br/></span></p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>No, I'm not a <strong>petrol head</strong> \u2013 which is somebody who loves cars and driving. But I know Eddie Jordan, a racing team owner, is. And what does he love about driving? He'll answer this question himself. Let's listen.</p>, <p><strong>INSERT<br/> </strong><strong><span>Eddie Jordan, racing team owner<br/></span></strong><span>When I get in a car I feel a different person, I feel that I'm now in control. I can turn on the music or I can turn it off. I can do all sorts of different things that I feel good about. When I was flat out with the Jordan team I did have a driver and that was one to be able to make calls and to be able to receive calls and to be able to work in the car, not because I didn't want to drive and I always felt cheated because there was a driver there taking the pleasure that I should be having. So when I get in a car it has to be a fun experience.</span></p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Eddie Jordan there. And doing something <strong>flat out</strong> means 'at maximum capacity'. Do you feel like a different person when you're driving, Alice?</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>No. And \u2013 unlike Eddie Jordan \u2013 I'd love to have a driver or a driverless car, for that matter. It gives you time to do other things, like getting some work done. I certainly wouldn't feel cheated of the pleasure of driving!</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I agree with Eddie Jordan. I would feel a bit cheated. And I have to admit: I'm a bit of a <strong>backseat driver</strong>. I sit in the passenger seat and give the driver unwanted advice.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well just think, Neil, in a driverless car, you wouldn't need to give the computer advice because it would be making the right decisions to get you to your destination safely.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>But can you override the computer? You know, if you felt that it was making bad decisions?</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong><strong>Override</strong> in this context means 'to stop an automatic action by taking control yourself'. Airline pilots do that, don't they? They fly on autopilot for most of the journey, but override it in order to take control of the plane for take-off and landing.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I would feel happier if I could take back control of an automated car if I wanted to.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well, let's listen now to Brian Fung, a technology reporter, who's experienced what it is to be in a driverless car<span> that has no steering wheels, no brake pedals, no emergency brake, no gear shifter. Google is developing a car in which everything will be self-contained.</span></p>, <p><strong>INSERT<br/> </strong><strong><span>Brian Fung, technology reporter<br/></span></strong><span>Well, the biggest thing you notice right off the bat is that the car accelerates a little bit more aggressively than a regular car might and it brakes a little more aggressively than a regular car might but other than that it takes about ten seconds for you to get pretty comfortable. And the car knew how to stop for red lights; it knew how to run through yellow lights, it could detect pedestrians and navigate its way around parked cars. All in all, it felt very similar to a regular car-driving experience. And I think that's one of the most surprising and exciting things about it \u2013 it's how mundane it was.</span></p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Brian Fung says he noticed right off the bat that the Google car accelerated and braked more aggressively than a regular car \u2013 and <strong>right off the bat </strong>means 'immediately'.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>But he also says it took him only ten seconds to get used to it and feel comfortable, as the car navigated appropriately and responded to different traffic situations, including pedestrians and parked cars.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, that all sounds very nice, but I think I'd still prefer to be <strong>in the driving seat</strong> \u2013 and that means 'in control of a situation'. You can take the driverless car, and do your work, Alice.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well, the future is likely to be all about automated transport \u2013 planes, trains, buses, and cars \u2013 and you simply won't have a choice, Neil.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Maybe you'll be allowed to hire a car you can drive yourself, just for fun.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Maybe. But I like the idea of a future with safe driverless roads.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I still need some convincing. And that brings us back to today's quiz question. Can you tell us the answer, now please, Alice?</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Of course I can! I asked: On average, around how many people around the world die each day from road accidents? Is it\u2026 a) 300, b) 3,000 or c) 30,000?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I said 3,000.</p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong>And unfortunately Neil that's right!

I'm Neil\u2026</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>And I'm Alice.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So Alice how did you spend Saturday night?</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Curled up on the sofa with a good book. You?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I went out on the town. Met some friends, had a few drinks, then went on to a party.<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well that illustrates the difference between us \u2013 you're an extrovert. And I'm\u2026 not. And where we are on the spectrum between introvert and extrovert is the subject of today's show.<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So would you call yourself an introvert, Alice?</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>No, I'm an <strong>ambivert</strong>, which means a mixture of introvert and extrovert.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, whichever you are, Alice, staying in on your own on a Saturday night is pretty boring!</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Not to me. And you shouldn't be so judgemental, Neil. You're reflecting the general view that people seem to have these days, that being an introvert is somehow less valuable than being an extrovert. Introverts have many valuable qualities. They're <strong>reflective</strong> \u2013 that means thoughtful \u2013 and have <strong>inner resources</strong>. In other words, they don't rely on other people to enjoy themselves.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>OK, well if you're feeling reflective at the moment, how about answering today's quiz question?</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>OK.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Can you tell me: who first used the term 'extrovert'? Was it\u2026<br/>a) Sigmund Freud?<br/>b) Friedrich Nietzsche?<br/>Or c) Carl Jung?</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>I think the answer is c) Carl Jung.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, we'll find out if you got the answer right or not later in the show. But before we get there, let's listen to Lisa Kaenzig, researcher and Associate Dean for William Smith College, New York State, telling us a bit more about what being an introvert typically means.</p>, <p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Lisa Kaenzig, researcher and Associate Dean for William Smith College, New York State<br/></strong>Introverts are people of any age who really get their energy from within themselves. And who often have sort of a running dialogue in their head going on thinking before they're talking, like to have a little more time to think through things before they're commenting on them or answering a question, need some time to recharge their batteries by being by themselves, and enjoy having alone time.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Lisa Kaenzig there \u2013 who says that introverts think about what they're going to say before they say it.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Do you do that, Neil?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Nope!</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>You should try it sometime. Now, Lisa also talks about the different ways people <strong>recharge their batteries</strong> \u2013 introverts tend to need time alone to regain their strength and energy when they're feeling <strong>drained</strong> \u2013 or very tired \u2013 whereas extroverts often prefer to recharge by being with other people.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So introverts create their energy internally \u2013 from within themselves \u2013 and extroverts recharge from being with other people.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Exactly. But in some situations, for example at school or in the workplace, things can be made suitable for \u2013 extroverts. Extroverts typically love being with others \u2013 in a big class or an open plan office \u2013 where there's a lot going on. They enjoy the external stimulation. But introverts can find these big, noisy environments uncomfortable.<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I can see that. And these days, people are wild about group work and brainstorming \u2013 job ads frequently ask if you are a people person, a team player \u2026 and so on.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>That's right. Introverts like to work alone or in small groups and need a quieter space to perform well. Let's listen now to Dr Peter Aloka, a researcher and psychologist in Kenya. He's been working with introvert teenage mothers in Bondo who are returning to school after having their babies. And schools are being asked to develop new strategies to support their learning.</p>, <p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Dr Peter Aloka, psychologist, Bondo, Kenya<br/></strong>Introverts might find it easier working in groups, but with smaller groups, and they work in pairs with extroverts\u2026 The teachers should design a classroom for all the students too, to contribute. Whenever a teacher is teaching a question in class let them allow for wait time for students to process the information before answering the question. Just for people to think through that question. Thinking, pairing, and sharing: those three strategies will help the introverts to speak out.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Dr Peter Aloka is talking about some very clever pairing there. If you put two introverts together they might not say anything. An extrovert is likely to talk, but won't <strong>intimidate</strong> \u2013 or overpower \u2013 their introvert partner as much as a large group would.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>So the idea is that with fewer people \u2013 in a small group or a pair \u2013 the introvert will have enough time and space to express their ideas. And because their ideas have been <strong>thought through</strong> \u2013 or carefully considered \u2013 , their contribution is likely to be worth waiting for. So\u2026 Think. Pair. Share.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Hmm. I like that. OK, so I think it's time to share the answer to today's quiz question. I asked: who first used the term \u2018extrovert'? Was it\u2026<br/>a) Sigmund Freud?<br/>b) Friedrich Nietzsche?<br/>Or c) Carl Jung?</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>I said\u2026 Carl Jung.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And you were\u2026 right, Alice. So thinking things through really works! \u2018Introvert' and \u2018extrovert' are the two basic personality types according to the theories of the 20th-century Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung. According to these theories, an introvert is a person whose interest lies with their own feelings and thoughts, in contrast to an extrovert, whose interest lies with other people and the outside world.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>OK. Now, let's hear the words we learned today:<br/>ambivert<br/>reflective<br/>inner resources<br/>recharge their batteries<br/>drained<br/>intimidate<br/>thought through</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, that's the end of this edition of 6 Minute English.

I'm trying to catch a Pok\u00e9mon.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>What?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Alice! Keep up! <em>Pok\u00e9mon Go</em> is a game where these little virtual monsters pop up onto your phone and you have to catch them. There it is again\u2026 Ha! Gotcha! I got Squirtle.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well done, Neil. Now the subject of today's show is crazes\u2026</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>\u2026 and <em>Pok\u00e9mon Go </em>is a good example. When it was first released, so many people were downloading the app that servers were crashing all over the place.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Perhaps I should explain at this point that a <strong>craze </strong>or a<strong> fad</strong> is a sudden and widespread enthusiasm for something, which only lasts a short time. So why do you think this craze for <em>Pok\u00e9mon Go</em> took off, Neil?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>It uses augmented reality \u2013 and that's exciting new technology! It's fun to play outside \u2013 and the game was released over the summer when people want to be outside. And \u2026 people are already familiar with the monsters since they were created back in 1995.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong><strong>Augmented reality</strong> by the way, is where digital information is layered on top of what you see through a smartphone or other device, \u2018augmenting' or adding to it.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I love this game. But then again, I loved other games in the past. I still have some toys and gadgets from my childhood at home. If there was a fad I would join in, I'm afraid.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well, let me test your knowledge about toys that turned into fads. Tell me: what is the best-selling toy of all time? Is it:<br/>a) the space hopper?<br/>b) the Rubik's cube also known as magic cube?<br/>Or c) the cabbage patch doll?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I'll say b) the Rubik's cube. I have one and, so do my cousin, my neighbour... my brother\u2026 my dog\u2026</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well, we'll find out if you got the answer right or not later on in the show. But why do we like to participate in crazes? Dr Ben Michaelis, a clinical psychologist from Columbia University in the US, explains.</p>, <p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Dr Ben Michaelis, clinical psychologist and visiting scholar at Columbia University, US<br/></strong>When a person or a group perceives an idea or a process or a product as being beneficial to one person or to a group of people, they immediately want to experience that benefit for themselves, which hooks into an ancient evolutionary fear of being left behind or abandoned by our tribes, and so more people join in.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So Ben Michaelis believes that people join crazes because they are afraid of being abandoned by others in their group. But I don't think that's true for me \u2013 I just enjoy playing games!</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Yes, but why have you switched from <em>Angry Birds</em>, to <em>Minecraft</em>, to <em>Pok\u00e9mon Go </em>in the space of a year? And before that there was Candy Crush and\u2026</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, I get bored after a while.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>So it isn't because other people stop playing it? And they stop talking about it? And it stops being a group thing?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Hmm. Maybe there is an element of that. Anyway, I like the idea that we join a craze because it's <strong>beneficial</strong> \u2013 or good \u2013 for us.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>I'm not convinced that playing <em>Pok\u00e9mon Go</em> is beneficial. Did you know, Neil, that in terms of personality type, people who are more emotionally insecure are far more likely to follow a craze? You know, sort of, herd mentality?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong><strong>Herd mentality</strong> describes how people are influenced by their peers to adopt certain behaviours. But it's fun to be connected with others through a craze. Aren't you troubled by FOMO?</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong><strong>FOMO</strong> \u2013 or fear of missing out? Oh no, I have a strong sense of self. But\u2026 well, I must admit I like loom bands. Do you remember those little rubber bands you could make jewellery and other stuff out of?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, I remember. David Beckham wore a loom band bracelet\u2026</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>So did the Duchess of Cambridge. They were very popular a couple of years ago and came from a simple idea. Cheong Choon Ng, an immigrant from Malaysia living in the United States, invented the Rainbow Loom after watching his daughters play. Let's hear his story.</p>, <p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Cheong Choon Ng, inventor of the Rainbow Loom<br/></strong>The idea of loom band came from my daughters. So one day they came home from school. Two of them were teaching each other how to make rubber band bracelets from those small tiny ponytail size rubber bands. I tried to impress them by making a thicker bracelet that was made from a prototype loom that I fabricated. And it was a success. And they were telling me that 'those bracelets are so cool, can you make more?'</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Cheong Choon Ng made a <strong>prototype</strong> \u2013 a first model of a machine from which all others would develop. He posted a video of his daughters making the bracelets and these went viral on the internet.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Interesting. Now, I think it's time for the answer to today's quiz question.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Yes. I asked: what is the best-selling toy of all time? Is it: a) the space hopper, b) the Rubik's cube also known as magic cube, or c) the cabbage patch doll?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>It has to be the Rubik's cube!</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>And indeed it is. In the 35 years since the puzzle was available to buy outside of Hungary, where its inventor came from, approximately 350m Rubik's cubes have been sold, making it the world's best-selling toy. And they are clever little toys, I must say \u2013 there's some maths in them. Now, let's hear the words we learned today.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>They were:<br/>craze<br/>fad<br/>augmented reality<br/>beneficial<br/>herd mentality<br/>FOMO<br/>prototype<br/>And that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

And I feel terrible!\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>You look terrible, Neil \u2013 if you don't mind me saying so!\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>It's because I had to get up really early this morning.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Oh dear! What time did you have to get up?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Eight o'clock.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Oh, Neil! That isn't early! I get up at six every day. It's so peaceful early in the morning.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Hmm. Well, some people are morning people and others\u2026 aren't!</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Yes. Well, today we're talking about the biological reason for this \u2013 it's all about<strong> circadian rhythms</strong>. They are produced by a so-called body clock in our brains that regulates our body functions: our body temperature, sleepiness and alertness, hunger, and hormone levels. Plants, animals, and many microbes have circadian rhythms.\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>You know a lot about circadian rhythms.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>And I'll ask you a question related to them. What does the word 'circadian' mean? Is it\u2026<br/>a) around a day?<br/>b) every day?<br/>or c) twice a day?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Hmm. I'm going to say a) around a day.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well, we'll find out whether you got the answer right or not later on in the show. Now let's talk about circadian rhythms and our internal clock.\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Why do our bodies need an internal clock to tell us where we are in the day? Isn't it obvious?\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>No, it isn't \u2013 take jet lag, for example. We rely on the predictable cycle of light or dark in a 24-hour period to <strong>synchronise</strong> \u2013 or adjust \u2013 our body clocks to the environment \u2013 and if we mess about with the light and dark cycle by flying into a new time zone, it makes us feel really bad!</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Good point \u2013 <strong>jet lag</strong> is the disruption of our circadian rhythms caused by high-speed travel across different time zones, which can cause tiredness and sleep problems. But Alice, if we rely on day turning to night to adjust our body clocks, what happens to blind people? \u2013 Because I assume their body clocks can't do this.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Blind people who have some light perception are able to synchronise their circadian rhythms to the light-dark cycle. But those who have no light perception at all\u2026 well, let's listen now to Debra Skene, Professor of Neuroendocrinology at the University of Surrey. She can explain what happens.</p>, <p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Debra Skene, Professor of Neuroendocrinology at the University of Surrey<br/></strong>Totally blind people \u2013 they've lost that connection between the light-dark circle and the clock. So there isn't anything wrong with the clock but the clock ticks and oscillates at its own endogenous period just the same as if I were to put you in a dark cave. Your biological internal clock would oscillate at your endogenous circadian period.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So if you're totally blind \u2013 or able to see but living in a dark cave \u2013 you have a ticking clock but with no connection to the outside world. The clock oscillates at its own <strong>endogenous</strong>, or internal, period.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong><strong>Oscillate</strong> means to move back and forth in a regular rhythm \u2013 like the pendulum on a clock.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Do you think my endogenous clock ticks faster than yours, Alice?</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>It isn't a competition, Neil. And actually, mine probably ticks faster than yours since I'm a morning person. Anyway, the normal range in humans is between 23.8 to 24.8 hours. And this is also true for totally blind people.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>But their clocks are free-running \u2013 they don't get cues from the outside environment telling them when to wake up, when to eat, when to feel sleepy. So that means they might feel sleepy at the wrong time of day \u2013 for example, when they're at work. Or alert in the middle of the night when they should be asleep.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>It's worth talking about people who do <strong>shift work</strong> too \u2013 which means work that takes place outside the traditional 9 to 5 day.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Shift workers may suffer similar problems to blind people because they are trying to sleep against the clock. They might sleep in the day and work at night for example \u2013 which goes against the light-dark pattern.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>There are some long-term health problems associated with shift work \u2013 certain cancers, heart disease, and obesity.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So what can people do to help adapt their circadian rhythms to a night shift schedule?</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well, let's hear what Professor Debra Skene has to say about it.</p>, <p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Debra Skene, Professor of Neuroendocrinology at the University of Surrey<br/></strong>We do think that exercise and food, caffeine, may be able to modulate in some way, so has some influence on circadian timing, but not as strongly as the light-dark cycle.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So the strongest influence over our circadian rhythm is the light-dark cycle. We can't alter night and day, after all!</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Debra Skene says that other cues such as food and exercise will <strong>modulate</strong> \u2013 or adjust \u2013 the body clock. So eating three well-balanced meals at regular times each day can help your body clock adapt to an unusual schedule.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Taking <strong>naps</strong> \u2013 or short sleeps \u2013 just before you start a night shift can help you feel more alert. And keeping to the same sleep schedule every day will also help.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>And don't forget caffeine \u2013 my old friend! A cup of coffee works wonders for me in the morning. Now remember I asked: What does 'circadian' mean? Is it\u2026 a) around a day, b) every day or c) twice a day?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I said around a day.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>And you were\u2026 right! Well done, Neil. The term 'circadian' comes from the Latin <em>circa</em>, meaning 'around' (or 'approximately'), and <em>di</em><em>\u0113</em><em>m</em>, meaning 'day'.

She was the last pharaoh to rule Egypt and is arguably the most famous female ruler in history.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And the most beautiful.</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Well, <strong>the jury's out on that one</strong>, Neil \u2013 and that means people haven't decided yet. Coins with Cleopatra's portrait on them, for example, show her with a prominent nose and thin lips.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong><strong>Prominent</strong> means noticeable \u2013 and in this case, I think it means large! So what were her <strong>attributes</strong> \u2013 or main qualities \u2013, then?</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Cleopatra was a wily politician. She made important alliances with Rome to protect her country and was ruthless in dealing with her enemies \u2013 in this case, her siblings \u2013 who challenged her as sole ruler of Egypt.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong><strong>Wily</strong> means clever and<strong> sibling</strong> is another word for brother or sister. Didn't she have her siblings murdered?</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Yes, she was very <strong>ruthless</strong> \u2013 and that means without pity. And today's quiz question is about her family. Can you tell me, Neil, which country was Cleopatra's family originally from? Is it\u2026<br/>a) Macedonia?<br/>b) Ethiopia?<br/>Or c) Egypt?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I'm going for c) Egypt \u2013 The obvious answer.</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Well, we'll find out if the obvious answer is the right one, later on in the show. But let's talk some more about Cleopatra's attributes. She may not have been Hollywood gorgeous, but she spoke many languages and was highly educated in philosophy, astronomy, mathematics, and oratory. Here's Susan Walker, Keeper of Antiquities at the Ashmolean Museum at the University of Oxford, with more about this.</p>, <p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Susan Walker, Keeper of Antiquities at the Ashmolean Museum, University of Oxford<br/></strong>Plutarch says that what was really remarkable about Cleopatra was not so much her beauty as the intelligence of her company. She had a very beautiful voice, which I think is a quality that we perhaps underrate these days, in estimations of celebrity, and she clearly had masses of charisma; the sort of person who would light up a room; so, enormous personal charm.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So the Roman historian Plutarch wrote about Cleopatra's voice, her charisma and personal charm \u2013 but not about her beauty.<br/><br/><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>That's right. And<strong> charisma </strong>is, in other words, a strong power to attract people. Cleopatra's voice was also considered very attractive \u2013 an attribute we underrate today, according to Susan Walker.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And <strong>underrate</strong> means to place too small a value on something.</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Egyptian Pharaohs were regarded as gods \u2013 and <strong>spectacle</strong> \u2013 or making a big visual impact \u2013 was an important part of this. Cleopatra was very skilled at making grand entrances.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Rolled up in a carpet for Caesar, or dressed up as Venus on board a shimmering golden barge, for Mark Anthony. He was a Roman politician and general.</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>And even her death was spectacular. She and Mark Anthony had lost an important battle against another Roman general, Octavian. Mark Anthony had fatally wounded himself when he heard, mistakenly, that Cleopatra was dead. But before he died, he managed to get back to Cleopatra, who held him in her arms as he died, in her family tomb. Then she decided to take her own life.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>You make it sounds like a Shakespearian tragedy!</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Shakespeare did write a play about it. Now, let's hear from Catherine Edwards, Professor of Classics and Ancient History at Birkbeck, University of London, about this tragic event.</p>, <p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Catherine Edwards, Professor of Classics and Ancient History at Birkbeck, University of London<br/></strong>She plans her own death in this very sort of calculated manner \u2013 a manner that also seems to focus on spectacle yet again. She takes her time, she has a feast, and then, you know, the figs, the basket of figs arrives with the asp in it \u2013 or was it perhaps a poisoned hairpin \u2013 there's a certain amount of uncertainty about the exact method of her death. I think most sources prefer the snake.</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>So Catherine Edwards says the facts surrounding Cleopatra's suicide aren't clear. She may have used a snake to bite her, smuggled into her room in a basket of fruit \u2013 but it may have been a poisoned hairpin \u2013 or simply a cup of poison. But she did it in a <strong>calculated</strong> \u2013 or carefully planned \u2013 way.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>OK, so the final curtain comes down on Cleopatra \u2013 but what about the answer to today's quiz question, Sophie?</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>OK. I asked: which country was Cleopatra's family originally from? Is it\u2026a) Macedonia, b) Ethiopia or c) Egypt?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I said\u2026 Egypt! Of course it is!</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>And that's the wrong answer, Neil. It's actually a) Macedonia. Cleopatra was a member of the Ptolemaic dynasty, a family of Macedonian Greek origin that ruled Egypt after the death of Alexander the Great.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>You learn something new every day!

I'm Neil\u2026</p>, <p><strong>Sophie\u00a0<br/></strong>And I'm Sophie. Neil, what are you afraid of?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I'm not keen on anything with wings, but I particularly hate moths. They're disgusting, with their fat hairy bodies and\u2026 fluttery wings!</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Oh, Neil. Moths are completely harmless. They aren't something to be scared of.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, they are\u2026 They get in my face\u2026 and my hair. It makes my flesh creep just thinking about them.</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>If something<strong> makes your flesh creep</strong> it makes you feel very frightened. Well, I hope you're going to survive the show today, Neil, because it's all about animal phobias \u2013 and a <strong>phobia</strong> is a strong and <strong>irrational</strong> fear. That's a fear not based on reason.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>OK \u2013 I'll try. Do you have any animal phobias, Sophie?</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>I can't stand dogs.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Man's best friend? How can you not like dogs \u2013 they're cute and loveable. They protect you. They can do tricks!</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Look, for you it's moths \u2013 and that's pretty ridiculous, by the way \u2013 and for me it's dogs. And that isn't ridiculous. Dogs can be aggressive \u2013 they have sharp teeth, they bear their teeth and bark.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>What, like this? [sound of dog growling and barking]</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Yes \u2013 and please turn that off, it's upsetting me. It's time for today's quiz question. Can you tell me, Neil, what's the word that describes an irrational fear of insects? Is it\u2026</p>, <p>a) entomophobia?</p>, <p>b) thanatophobia?</p>, <p>Or c) pogonophobia?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I'll say thanatophobia.</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Well, we'll find out if you got the answer right later on in the show. But now let's listen to Dr Dean Burnett, neuroscientist at Cardiff University in the UK, talking about what causes phobic reactions in us.</p>, <p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Dr Dean Burnett, neuroscientist at Cardiff University, UK<br/></strong>The sensory information is just relayed directly into your brain. One part of it is routed into the cortex, where it's sort of thought about: 'that's that thing, I know that from last time I experienced this', and you can kind of rationalise your way through it. But it also sends a message directly to the amygdala, which immediately triggers the 'fight or flight' response \u2013 bang, fire alarm, off it goes, flood the body just in case. It's a survival mechanism.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Dr Dean Burnett there. So, the sensory information for me is a moth fluttering around, getting in my hair.</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>That's right \u2013 Or for me, it's a dog getting anywhere near me! Anyway, this information goes into our brains and is processed in two different parts of the brain \u2013 the central cortex and the amygdala.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And the information sent to the central cortex triggers a rational response, like, oh it's only a harmless moth \u2013 and the stuff that goes to the amygdala triggers an instinctive reaction \u2013 the fight or flight response \u2013 like, aaarrrggghhh! It's a disgusting moth! Get away from me!</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>The <strong>fight or flight response </strong>is a normal response to stress or danger, and it involves the hormone adrenalin being pumped quickly round the body. The problem is this response can get triggered when there isn't any danger. And this is at the heart of what a phobia is.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So, that's the moth flying in my face while I'm reading in bed, and I feel my heart beating so fast I think I'm going to pass out and I nearly die from anxiety.</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Poor Neil! <strong>Pass out</strong> means to faint or lose consciousness, by the way. Well, we're going to hear from Stephen and Reena now, two self-confessed arachnophobes. They have strong emotional reactions just like you, Neil. Can you identify which animal they fear?</p>, <p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Stephen and Reena, arachnophobes<br/></strong>'So when I see a spider, I feel like I've been punched in the chest.'<br/>'Complete fear \u2013 it's absolutely paralysing. They've never been OK with me. I've always hated them.'<br/>'I've spent a lot of time driving around in the car afraid to go home while my husband worked in London.'<br/>'All rationality goes out the window, and it's\u2026 my emotions completely take over.'<br/>'I just\u2026. I just run.'</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>So<strong> arachnophobes</strong> have a strong fear of spiders. And it's the most common animal phobia apparently.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>You could understand that if you were living in Australia \u2013 where a bite from a spider might kill you. But the little spiders you get here in the UK don't seem threatening at all.</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Yes, but recent research has shown that we have a <strong>reflexive awareness</strong> of spiders \u2013 whether we fear them or not \u2013 which means we can spot them automatically without thinking about it. And we don't have the same reflexive awareness of houseflies \u2013 or moths \u2013 for example.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I expect this awareness is to do with our ancestors. It would've been extremely useful to spot a spider as an early human on the plains of the African Savannah. A bite might kill you \u2013 or make you vulnerable to attack from other animals.</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>You're right, Neil! But do you think you were right about today's quiz question? I asked: What's the word that describes an irrational fear of insects? Is it\u2026 a) entomophobia, b) thanatophobia or c) pogonophobia?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I said thanatophobia!</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>That's the wrong answer. It's actually a) entomophobia. Entomophobia (also known as insectophobia) is a specific phobia characterized by an excessive or unrealistic fear of one or more classes of insect. Thanatophobia is the fear of death and pogonophobia is the fear of beards or bearded people.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, moths are kind of hairy\u2026 Let's remind ourselves of some of the words we heard today:<br/>make your flesh creep<br/>phobia<br/>irrational<br/>fight or flight response<br/>pass out<br/>arachnophobes<br/>reflexive awareness</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>And that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

I'm Alice\u2026</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>And I'm Neil.<span><br/></span></p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>The BBC's 100 Women season is back this week. It will explore women's stories of defiance. And it will include stories of women who inspired us. And that's what we are going to talk about today.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And which woman has inspired you, Alice?</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Oh, well, I have many female <strong>role models</strong> \u2013 and this means people looked to by others as examples to be followed. But I must say I have a great admiration for the <strong>suffragettes</strong>.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Ah, the women who fought for the right to vote in the UK!\u00a0 Yes, I think they were very brave.\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Yes, so do I. Let's see how much you know about it, Neil. This is today's quiz question for you: Which was the first country to give all women the right to vote in public elections? Was it\u2026<br/>a) Finland?<br/>b) New Zealand?<br/>Or c) The US?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I'm going to say\u2026 a) Finland.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well, we'll see if you were right or not later on in the show. // Here in Britain, women's groups <strong>lobbied</strong> \u2013 or tried to persuade \u2013 parliament for decades before eventually winning the right for all women to vote in 1928.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So why did it take so long?</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Because parliament didn't see votes for women as a priority. Then, 30% of men still didn't have the vote either and politicians felt they needed to address this before thinking about \u2018the woman question' as it was known.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>The thing is, without the power to vote it's hard to influence public policy. Politicians are worried about losing popularity with the <strong>electorate</strong> \u2013 that's the people who are allowed to vote.<span><br/></span></p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Women had to find a voice \u2013 and the Suffragette Movement gave them a voice.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>There were several activists in this movement, but perhaps the most famous was Emmeline Pankhurst.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Emmeline Pankhurst campaigned fearlessly for women's rights for all women \u2013 aristocratic ladies, factory workers, conservatives, socialists. Let's listen to Julia Bush, author of <em>Women Against the Vote</em>, talking more about this suffragette leader.</p>, <p><strong>INSERT<br/> </strong><strong><span>Julia Bush, author of <em>Women Against the Vote<br/></em></span></strong><span>She was a very charismatic leader, one of the great women of the 19th century. And she had a deep compassion for the plight of women. And in particular she was fired by the inequalities that women experienced at that time. It wasn't just about the parliamentary vote, the Suffragette Movement, it was, she in particular wanted wider reforms for women, an improvement in women's status and position.</span></p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Author Julia Bush.She talks about the plight of women.<strong> Plight </strong>means 'a bad situation'.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Women did have a really hard time back then \u2013 especially working class women. And they had little hope of improving their lives because they had no public voice.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So that's what Julia Bush means when she says Mrs Pankhurst wanted wider reforms \u2013 access to better schools for women, to university, to better paid jobs and professional careers.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>And it was a big challenge to be heard. June Purvis, Emeritus Professor of Women's and Gender History at the University of Portsmouth here in the UK, talks about how the suffragettes started to <strong>raise their profile </strong>\u2013 or get noticed \u2013 with deeds not words.</p>, <p><strong>INSERT<br/> </strong><strong><span>June Purvis,</span></strong><span> </span><strong><span>Emeritus Professor of Women's and Gender History at the University of Portsmouth, UK<br/></span></strong><span>You have women interrupting theatre plays, getting thrown out of church services for interrupting, getting thrown out of Lyons Corner House for standing up on chairs and having little impromptu meetings. But militancy also takes on other forms. It takes on forms of direct action, which start with large demonstrations when women will not be turned back by the police and then it moves on in other forms as well to criminal damage.</span></p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So women started to interrupt public events to talk about their right to vote.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>An <strong>impromptu</strong> meeting is one that hasn't been planned. Lyons Corner House was a chain of teashops popular at the time. You can imagine that women suddenly standing up on chairs and addressing the public would have been quite shocking in those days!</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Indeed! The suffragettes started small with teashop talks but they began to take more <strong>militant</strong> \u2013 or aggressive \u2013 direct action.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>And <strong>direct action</strong> means using demonstrations, strikes. The suffragettes chained themselves to railings, broke shop windows.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>It was quite a struggle, and there was no way of delaying the decision to give women the right to vote. In 1914 war broke out in Europe. And with the men away fighting, many women ran their homes, cared for children and relatives, managed money, and often had a job as well.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>So when the war ended in 1918 women had proved how capable they were in so many ways. To deny them the right to vote now seemed ridiculous.<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Although it took another ten years before all women were given the vote on equal terms to men. But come on, Alice, it must be time to hear the answer to today's quiz question!</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>I asked: Which was the first country to give all women the right to vote in public elections? Was it\u2026 a) Finland? b) New Zealand? Or c) The US?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I said Finland.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>No, sorry, Neil. It was b) New Zealand. In 1893, New Zealand became the first country to give all adult women the right to vote in national elections.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Now, shall we remind ourselves the words we learned today?</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/> </strong>Yes. They were:<br/>role models<br/>suffragettes<br/>lobbied<br/>electorate<br/>plight<br/>raised their profile<br/>impromptu<br/>militant<br/>direct action</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>That's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

They are <strong>ubiquitous</strong> \u2013 that means you can find them everywhere! People wear them across the globe \u2013 men, women, kids, teenagers and pensioners. And did you know that 85% of people who buy trainers don't wear them for sport?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>That makes sense to me. I wear mine because they're comfortable.</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>They're also very <strong>tatty</strong> \u2013 that means old and in bad condition \u2013 if you don't mind me saying so.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Hmm.

Now, it has become socially acceptable to wear athletic <strong>apparel</strong> or clothing \u2013 including trainers \u2013 in situations where ten years ago it would not.\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, I think my apparel of jeans and tatty trainers is socially acceptable \u2013 at our workplace, anyway.</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Mark Zuckerberg, founder of Facebook, is famous for his <strong>dressed-down</strong> \u2013 or informal \u2013 look of hoodies and trainers. You can pay anything from a few pounds for unbranded trainers to thousands of pounds for limited edition brands like Nike or Addidas \u2013 and <strong>limited edition</strong> means something produced in very small numbers.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Why would anybody spend a thousand pounds on trainers? And how many people would actually recognize that you were wearing Nike limited edition ones rather than regular ones?<span><br/></span></p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Other sneakerheads, Neil \u2013 a <strong>sneakerhead</strong> is somebody who collects limited edition sneakers. It's an American term. But trainers are not new - in the nineteenth century, people wore sneakers as a mark of their <strong>prosperity</strong> \u2013 or economic success. Let's listen to Elizabeth Semmelhack, curator of the Bata Shoe Museum in Toronto in Canada.</p>, <p><strong>INSERT<br/> </strong><strong><span>Elizabeth Semmelhack, curator of the Bata Shoe Museum in Toronto, Canada<br/></span></strong><span>This new industrial age actually ushered in a new class, the emerging middle class, that was able to, now, have leisure time, because of their new economic success. And so what they did was, they wanted to, sort of, express the fact that they had leisure time by playing. But they also wanted to signify that they were doing these things by their sartorial choices. And so the sneaker, in part, was invented to meet the needs of this new class, so that they could very conspicuously show that they were playing.</span></p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>What does it mean to <strong>usher</strong> <strong>in</strong>, Sophie?</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>It means to mark the beginning of something. In this case, the industrial revolution marked the beginning of a new social class \u2013 the middle class \u2013 who made a lot of money from industry.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And why were they interested in trainers?</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>They wanted a way of showing people that they were so rich they didn't need to work all the time. And by wearing trainers they were saying, 'I'm busy playing tennis'. <strong>Sartorial</strong>, by the way, means 'related to clothes'.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>These days wearing trainers doesn't reveal much about social class. For example, Mark Zuckerberg and I look surprisingly similar in our hoodies and trainers. You'd have to guess which one of us was a multibillionaire \u2013 and which one was\u2026 not!</p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>People respond to current trends in popular sport through the trainers they wear. And here's Matt Powell for the US consumer research group, NPD, to tell us more.</span></p>, <p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong><span>Matt Powell, US consumer research group, NPD<br/></span></strong><span>When I first got into the retail business in the 70s the sexy sport, if you will, was tennis.\u00a0</span><span>And we all wore tennis apparel for casual wear, and we played tennis, and we wore tennis shoes. And we identified with athletes like McEnroe, and Borg, and Connors. Over time though, it has become even a broader range, there was a jogging craze in the 70s \u2013 everybody was out jogging, and then that became a full-fledged running business. The basketball business really exploded in the mid late 80s with the emergence of Michael Jordan. </span></p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>So Matt Powell knows a thing or two about current consumer trends - he says in the 1970s there was a <strong>craze</strong> \u2013 or enthusiasm \u2013 for tennis and jogging. And this led to big sales of the apparel associated with these sports.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Are tennis shoes still sexy, Sophie?</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Maybe \u2013 but basketball hi-tops are sexier. Michael Jordan started that trend back in the 1980s and it's still going strong. Well, we're running out of time. Let's go back to our quiz question. I asked you: What is a slang term for trainers? Is it\u2026 a) kicks, b) wedges or c) flats?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>It has to be kicks. I'm right, aren't I?</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>I have to tell you, Neil, you're\u2026 right!</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes!</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Wedges are shoes or boots with a triangular wedge-shaped heel and flats are a woman's shoe with no heel.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I<strong> know my onions, </strong>you see, Sophie.</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Yes, in other words, you know a lot about something you do.

I'm Sophie\u2026</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>And I'm Neil. Did you watch the Tour de France cycle race this summer, Sophie?</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>No, I didn't. I'm not a cycling enthusiast, Neil \u2013 unlike you!</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>It was pretty exciting stuff \u2013 in fact just thinking about it, makes me want to jump on my bike and ride off right now!</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Don't go just yet, because today's show is all about bicycles and I've got a question for you. Who invented the first <strong>pneumatic</strong> \u2013 or air-filled \u2013 cycle tyre in 1888?\u00a0 Was it \u2026<br/>a) John Boyd Dunlop?<br/>b) Charles Goodyear?<br/>Or c) Harvey Samuel Firestone?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, I'm going to go for a) John Boyd Dunlop. Can I go now?</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>No, you can't. We'll find out later on in the show if you got the tyre question right or not. But first, I'd like you to tell us a bit about the history of the bike.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>If you insist. Well, before the modern bike was invented in 1885, people rode boneshakers, high wheelers, and even tricycles.</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>A tricycle is a three-wheeler bike that young children ride before they learn to balance on a two-wheeler. But what's a \u2018boneshaker', Neil?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>It was the first bike with pedals, called a \u2018velocipede' by its manufacturers. Others called it a 'boneshaker' because its tyres were made of iron so it was very uncomfortable to ride \u2013 especially over cobblestone streets.</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>It sounds awful! Now, moving on, the bicycle started out as an expensive toy for the middle classes \u2013 but when manufacturing costs dropped, they became a vehicle for social change.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>By the late nineteenth century, bikes had become affordable for a large proportion of the population \u2013 and the technology had moved on so they weren't so dangerous \u2013 or so uncomfortable to ride.</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>And for the first time in history, people had the freedom to travel where they wanted when they wanted \u2013 including women! Let's hear more about women and cycling from Robert Penn, UK author, and lifelong cyclist.</p>, <p><strong>INSERT<br/> </strong><strong>Robert Penn, author, and lifelong cyclist<br/></strong>In very practical terms, it had a very significant effect on what women wore in public. And when they first rode bicycles they were expected to ride in long ankle length skirts and voluminous petticoats and of course that was entirely impractical so they adopted what was called rational dress. And rational dress was a better fitting jacket and pantaloon trousers which were cinched below the knee, which meant that nothing got caught in the chain. And at first there was massive public outrage. There were court cases about whether or not women were allowed to be served in pubs wearing this sort of dress.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So women in the nineteenth century typically wore long skirts and\u00a0<strong>voluminous</strong> \u2013 or large \u2013 petticoats. A <strong>petticoat</strong> is a piece of clothing worn under a dress or skirt. But what does \u2018rational dress' mean exactly, Sophie?</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong><strong>Rational</strong> here means logical. It wasn't logical to wear ankle length skirts with voluminous petticoats on a bike, so women started wearing pantaloon trousers.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong><strong>Pantaloon</strong> trousers were baggy \u2013 though they were <strong>cinched</strong> \u2013 or gathered in \u2013 below the knee so they wouldn't catch in the bicycle chain.</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>But pantaloons for women still caused <strong>outrage</strong> \u2013 or shock and anger \u2013 because although they were baggy, they were still trousers and they didn't go down to the ankle. So bikes played a part in women's struggle for <strong>emancipation</strong> \u2013 or freedom. But let's listen now to Robert Penn, who claims that it also played a role in our evolutionary history.</p>, <p><strong>INSERT<br/> </strong><strong>Robert Penn, author, and lifelong cyclist<br/></strong>It definitely shored up the gene pool in countries like Britain because it meant that people could go further than they ever had before in order to find a partner for life and to mate. And so what started as a really faddish leisure pursuit, within a decade of 1885, the bicycle became the most popular form of transport on the planet, and it has been ever since.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>What does <strong>shore up </strong>mean, Sophie?</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>It means support. And <strong>gene pool</strong> here refers to the collection of genes in a particular population. So, when people travelled further to marry and have children, they were making the gene pool bigger and healthier.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And Robert Penn uses the word \u2018faddish' he says cycling started as a faddish thing. A <strong>fad</strong> \u2013 or <strong>faddish</strong> activity \u2013 means an enthusiasm for something that doesn't last very long.</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>But your enthusiasm for cycling is not a fad.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>No, it isn't. \u00a0Do you think lycra wearing is a fad and we'll all go back to wearing pantaloons in the future, Sophie? No? Not a good look? OK, maybe it's time for the answer to today's quiz question.</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>I asked: Who invented the first cycle tyre in 1888?\u00a0 Was it \u2026 a) John Boyd Dunlop, b) Charles Goodyear or c) Harvey Samuel Firestone?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I said John Boyd Dunlop. Tell me I'm right!</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>You are\u2026 right! Well done, Neil. Scottish inventor and veterinary surgeon John Boyd Dunlop developed the pneumatic rubber tyre. Although it was invented as an improvement on the bicycle, the pneumatic tyre arrived on the scene just in time to contribute to the success of the car.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Now, here are the words we heard today. They are:<br/>pneumatic<br/>voluminous<br/>petticoat<br/>rational<br/>pantaloon<br/>cinched<br/>outrage<br/>emancipation<br/>shore up<br/>gene pool<br/>fad or faddish</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

I'm Sophie\u2026</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>And I'm Neil. Oh, hang on\u2026 I've just got a new tweet here. Listen to this: \u2018Hi Neil, about what you said the other day I\u2026' Oh, this is from a friend who doesn't realize that regular tweets are in the public domain \u2013 and that anyone in the world could read them if they wanted to. I need to give her some lessons in cool \u2013 she just doesn't get it!</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Well, Mr Cool, I don't <strong>get</strong> Twitter either \u2013 which means I don't understand why people like it. Why do you want to put tweets out there for everyone to read?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>You'd love it if you tried it, Sophie.</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>I'm not so sure, Neil. Anyway, the subject of today's show is online identity. There are lots of social media platforms out there \u2013 Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, Instagram \u2013 and they're all different, and the question is, do we use different identities when we are using different digital spaces? And what's all this tweeting, posting, and hashtagging doing to our language and our psyche?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And <strong>psyche</strong> means mind. Well, it's messed with my mind. I'm a total addict. I check my accounts as soon as I get up in the morning \u2013 and sometimes in the night if I wake up. I couldn't get through the day without it.</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Well, I'm the opposite \u2013 I'm totally unaddicted \u2013 and therefore don't need to worry about my psyche. Now, before we explore this further, let's have today's quiz question.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>OK, here's one for you, Sophie. Can you tell me how many social media accounts the average person has? Is it\u2026<br/>a) 3?<br/>b) 5?<br/>Or c) 8?</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>I'll say 3 \u2013 though that sounds like 3 too many to me.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>OK, we'll find out if you got the answer right later on in the show. I've got \u2026 3\u2026 5 no hang on. I've got 6\u2026</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>While you add up all your accounts, Neil, let's listen to Dr Aleks Krotoski, broadcaster, journalist and social psychologist. She's talking about the language we use to present ourselves online.</p>, <p><strong>INSERT<br/> </strong><strong>Dr Aleks Krotoski, broadcaster, journalist and social psychologist<br/></strong>Online we have this extraordinary opportunity to explore different aspects of ourselves through primarily text-based communication, by manipulating language and becoming wordsmiths ourselves. So for example, your Twitter handle will have a \u2018you' that is probably different from a \u2018you' that you share if, say, for example you have a Facebook account, or is different from a \u2018you' that you would share if you're on a particular forum of something that you like \u2013 some music that you like, or food that you like, or whatever it is.</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>So we are wordsmiths with handles. What does that mean?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>A <strong>wordsmith</strong> is someone who is skilled at using words. And a <strong>handle</strong> means a name.</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>What's your Twitter handle, then?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, you'll need to get a Twitter account to find out. But I have other handles for other social media.</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>So there are lots of \u2018yous' out there, Neil?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes. For example, I think I'm cooler on Twitter than on Facebook. I talk more, you know, street. \u2018Check out my new creps \u2013 they're bangin'.'</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Yo \u2013 they're well sick.<strong> Street</strong>, by the way, refers to the language that goes with street \u2013 or urban \u2013 culture, where things like skate boarding and hip-hop are popular. And I think \u2018creps' are trainers \u2013 am I right, bruv?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, Sophie. I didn't know you could talk street!</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>I have identities that you know nothing about, Neil! But getting back to Twitter and how big an audience there is, doesn't that huge audience worry you, Neil? Aren't you scared of making a huge blooper online and becoming a laughing stock?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>OK, <strong>blooper</strong> means an embarrassing mistake \u2013 and being <strong>a laughing stock</strong> means looking very silly when you were trying to be serious. Well, Sophie, I'm quite careful about how I manage my online identity. I take time to craft my words \u2013 just like I craft them for this show!</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Really? So no bloopers, on this show, then? I seem to remember one or two\u2026 Well, let's move on now and listen now to Dr Aleks Krotoski again,talking about what motivates us to put our thoughts and ideas out there online.</p>, <p><strong>INSERT<br/> </strong><strong>Dr Aleks Krotoski, broadcaster, journalist and social psychologist<br/></strong>It's allowing us a platform for a potential audience that is massive, absolutely huge, so yeah, there is a lot of \u2018look at me, look at me' online, but that's, I think, because we're trying to reach out to as much of the audience \u2013 we're trying to get as much attention as we possibly can, in order to get that tribe. And, also, in order to basically reach out and tell people, 'Hey we're around'. It's like having a telephone on all the time: \u2018Hey, chat to me. I'm here. Anybody wanna hang out?' It's a big social playground.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Aleks Krotoski says we're all show offs who want attention. Am I a show off, Sophie?</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Yes, you are, Neil. Though Aleks says it isn't just about showing off \u2013 it's also about connecting with people in our <strong>tribe</strong> \u2013 or social group. But that tribe can be enormous because people are reading posts globally \u2013 not just in your own town or even your own country.<span><br/></span></p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Hastag scarythought! Now, I think it's time for the answer to today's quiz question. I asked: How many social media accounts does the average person have? Is it\u2026 a) 3, b) 5 or c) 8?</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>I said b) 3.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And that is \u2026 not the right answer, Sophie. The average person has 5 social media accounts and spends around 1 hour and 40 minutes browsing these networks every day, accounting for 28% of the total time spent on the internet. Now, here are the words we heard today:<br/>get something<br/>psyche<br/>wordsmith<br/>handle<br/>street<br/>blooper<br/>laughing stock<br/>tribe</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>And that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

I'm Sophie\u2026</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>And I'm Neil.</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>What are you reading?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>A news blog \u2013 it says here that the fossil of a two-headed dinosaur has been discovered in Greece. Look! Look at this picture!</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Honestly, Neil, you shouldn't believe everything you read on the internet! This story is from one of those fake news websites that float about on social media. And you aren't the only one to get taken in \u2013 even serious news channels report these types of stories as if they were true.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong><strong>Taken in</strong> means fooled by something. Well, I must admit, I did believe it. And I didn't know that <strong>fake</strong> \u2013 or pretend \u2013 news sites existed. How am I supposed to know what's fake and what's real? So many extraordinary things happen!</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>That's a good question, and actually, digital news and its effect on traditional newspapers is the subject of today's show. The thing is, if you read a traditional print newspaper like I do, you'd find stories that are more <strong>reliable</strong> \u2013 ones you can trust.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, enjoy your traditional print newspaper while you can, Sophie, because they're going to disappear pretty soon \u2013 the same way as the dinosaurs!</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Hmm. It is true that print newspapers are <strong>feeling the pinch</strong> these days \u2013 and that means not making enough money. But I will miss them if they go. Which brings me on to today's quiz question. Neil, how many national print newspapers are currently sold in the UK a day? Is it\u2026<br/>a) 70,000?<br/>b) 700,000?<br/>Or c) 7 million?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, I'll go for a) 70,000. It can't be much more than that, surely.</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Well, we'll find out whether you got the answer right or not later in the show. But moving on now, we've discussed one disadvantage of digital news \u2013 that it can be hard to distinguish a real story from a fake one \u2013 given the mass of information available on the web. So maybe you should tell us about the advantages, Neil.\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, you can access news 24/7 \u2013 and search for it on your phone or tablet without having to flip through pages of stuff you aren't interested in. It isn't all in black and white, it isn't all about reading \u2013 you can watch and listen too. And make comments of your own.</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>OK. Well, let's listen to Tim Luckhurst, Professor of Journalism at Kent University, to see what he thinks is important in journalism nowadays.</p>, <p><strong><span>INSERT<br/></span></strong><strong><span>Tim Luckhurst, Professor of Journalism at Kent University<br/></span></strong><span>It doesn't matter whether your local journalist produces news on a tablet, on a mobile phone, in print, online, on television, or on radio. What matters is that there should be a diversity of journalism available and that it should be provided by professional reporters whose job is to do an honest objective job, impartially, in the public interest, not simply to rant or express opinions.</span></p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Tim Luckhurst there. He says that news will be successful on any platform \u2013 digital or traditional \u2013 so long as reporters are honest and objective in their pursuit of a good story. If you're <strong>objective</strong> it means you aren't influenced by personal feelings or opinions. If you <strong>rant</strong> you speak in an angry opinionated way about something.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Now, newspapers need to make money in order to pay their journalists. And with circulation falling dramatically, they need to find other ways to make newspapers pay.</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>A newspaper's <strong>circulation</strong> is the number of copies it distributes per day. Well, selling more advertising space is one way, isn't it?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, but many advertisers are choosing to use digital platforms because they reach a wider and more targeted audience. And this is one reason why digital news is taking over \u2013 it can pay for itself through advertising.</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>I\u00a0wouldn't mind paying more for a newspaper if I knew the quality of journalism is good.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>But increasingly people are expecting good quality journalism for free.</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Newspapers have been around since the invention of the printing press, and as <strong>chronicles</strong> \u2013 or written accounts \u2013 of people's lives, are an important historical resource. Let's listen to <span>Alex Cox, researcher at genealogy website, findmypast.co.uk</span> talking more about this.</p>, <p><strong>INSERT<br/> </strong><strong><span>Alex Cox, researcher at genealogy website, findmypast.co.uk <br/></span></strong>During the First World War local papers always printed In Memoriam columns where they'd list local dead. What a lot of them also did was they allowed relatives to submit short poems about their deceased loved ones and some of them were five or six lines \u2013 not very long \u2013 but they're really, really quite powerful. And the paper dedicated page space to print not just one of these, but multiple, and I don't know whether a modern paper would even consider doing that today.</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong><strong>Deceased</strong> is another word for dead \u2013 in this case, it refers to the British soldiers who died in the First World War.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Local papers, at the time, printed poems written by the families of the dead men. Those poems, captured in print, are an important historical record of the time.</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Indeed. Now, remember, Neil, I asked you: How many national print newspapers are currently sold in the UK a day?

I'm Sophie\u2026\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>And I'm Neil. So, Sophie, the subject of today's show is attraction \u2013 do you believe in love at first sight?\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>No, I don't. I think it takes time to get to know somebody well enough to know if you love them. But I have a friend who says when she saw her husband for the first time\u2026\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>That was before they got married?\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>That's right \u2013 when they met for the first time, that was it: a bolt out of the blue. And they got married three months later.\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>A<strong> bolt out of the blue </strong>means something totally unexpected. Well, that sounds very romantic. And leads me on to today's quiz question. Sophie, what percentage of Americans said they believe in love at first sight? Is it...<br/>a) 26%?<br/>b) 56%?<br/>Or c) 86%?\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>I'm not an old romantic like you Neil, so I'm going to go for a) 26%.\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, we'll find out later on in the show if you're right to be sceptical or not, Sophie. And <strong>sceptical</strong> for those of you who don't know, means to have doubts about something.\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>I think you can be physically attracted to somebody straight away. I just don't think you can fall in love with somebody so easily. Love is about other things: compatibility, personality and a good sense of humour.\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, humour is important, but apparently, Sophie, for men it's all about the waist-hip ratio. According to research, the ideal waist-hip ratio for women is 0.7 \u2013 where <strong>ratio</strong> means the relationship between two sizes \u2013 and you get this figure by dividing the waist measurement by the hip measurement.\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>I see. And why do men find 0.7 so irresistible?\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, let's listen to Dr Anna Machin, an Evolutionary Anthropologist from the University of Oxford, explaining what a man is looking for.\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>INSERT<br/> </strong><strong>Dr Anna Machin, Evolutionary Anthropologist, University of Oxford<br/></strong>He's going to look for signs for fertility and what we call fecundity and good health. And the major indicator of that in women is the waist-hip ratio. And the waist-hip ratio \u2013 the absolute ideal \u2013 what men find most attractive regardless of culture \u2013 this has been tested in many different cultures round the world \u2013 is 0.7 and that's really your classic hourglass figure. And the reason why that universally is attractive is because it's tied to the health of that individual. There's a very strong relationship between someone circulating oestrogen and testosterone \u2013 obviously you want the oestrogen to be high and the testosterone to be low for a woman to be fertile, and also her general health, so .7 is linked to lower risk of heart disease, lower risk of diabetes and certain sorts of cancers.\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So a waist-hip ratio of 0.7 <strong>correlates</strong> \u2013 or has a strong relationship \u2013 with good general health and fertility in women.\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>And men find this attractive because it identifies <strong>fertile</strong> women \u2013 women who will be able to <strong>conceive</strong> \u2013 or get pregnant \u2013 and have babies successfully.\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Dr Machin also mentions that 0.7 is the classic <strong>hourglass figure</strong> \u2013 which means curvy!\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Do you like curves, Neil?\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Mind your own business, Sophie. But all this waist-hip theory of attraction isn't very romantic, is it?\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>You're right, it isn't. And whilst we do judge people by the way they look \u2013 we also use our sense of smell to sniff out our ideal <strong>mate</strong> \u2013 or sexual partner. Apparently, we can detect whether people are genetically different to us by the way they smell. And parents who have different immune systems create healthier babies.\u00a0\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So it's back to having babies again \u2013 all biology and chemistry \u2013 and not about feelings at all.</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Well, let's leave chemistry behind for a moment and listen to Professor David Perrett, at the School of Psychology and Neuroscience at St Andrews University in Scotland. He talks about other factors that play a role in attraction.</p>, <p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>David Perrett, Professor at the School of Psychology and Neuroscience at St Andrews University in Scotland <br/> </strong>Plastic surgery really doesn't count for much in the end. You could be with somebody who's aesthetically very beautiful but if they don't smile or react then that counts for much less. So we can change our faces by interacting with others and doing so in a pleasant manner, and that will aid our attractiveness and make others interested in us.\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>What does <strong>aesthetically </strong>mean, Sophie?\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>It means judging something by the way it looks. And whilst we all enjoy a pretty face, most of us are looking for more than that. We are looking for people who appear friendly and approachable, and who we share interests with.\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Exactly \u2013 and personally, I think kind eyes are very important \u2013 with a bit of a twinkle. What about you, Sophie?\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>I like a good sense of humour.\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Very good. Now, remember I asked you, Sophie: What percentage of Americans said they believe in love at first sight? Is it\u2026 a) 26%, b) 56% or c) 86%?\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>I said 26%.\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Sorry, that's the wrong answer, Sophie. 56% of Americans believe in love at first sight, and the percentage is even higher for married people and those in relationships, according to a poll conducted by the website CBS.com in 2013.</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Well, Americans are a romantic bunch.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Me too, and I'm British.

I'm Sophie\u2026</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I'm Neil.</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>How was your weekend, Neil?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, not great \u2013 I hadn't got anything planned, so I didn't see anyone for two days. And to be honest, I felt very lonely! There was a real physical feeling in the pit of my stomach.</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Poor Neil! You do sound really <strong>down in the dumps</strong>, and that means unhappy! Well, the subject of today's show is loneliness. And <strong>loneliness</strong> is sometimes described as a social pain \u2013 a pain that tells us that we're <strong>isolated</strong> \u2013 or lacking contact with others \u2013 which motivates us to seek out companionship.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I'd no idea that feeling lonely had a biological explanation! How does being sociable help us, as a species, then, Sophie?</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>It's all about <strong>cooperation</strong> \u2013 or working together to get something done \u2013 for example, finding food.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, I suppose I cooperated with the pizza delivery guy for a shared outcome.</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>You paid him and he gave you the pizza?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Exactly. But it wasn't a socially enriching experience. That's the bad thing about London \u2013 you can feel lonely, even surrounded with people. It isn't easy to meet people you really like \u2013 so often you might as well just on your own.</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Good point. And I have a question about cities and living alone, Neil, because it's on the rise. Which country has the highest proportion of people living on their own? Is it \u2026<br/>a) the US?<br/>b) Japan?<br/>Or c) Sweden?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, I'm going to guess b) Japan.</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>OK, we'll see if you got that right later on in the show. So, getting back to loneliness \u2013 the idea is that because it makes us feel bad, it motivates us to go out and meet people. Some people are more likely to feel lonely than others because our genes play a role in this tendency.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I wonder if I inherited loneliness genes.</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>I don't know, Neil, but while in some situations being lonely may be a good thing, because it encourages you to be sociable, in other situations it may be useful to <strong>tolerate</strong> \u2013 or put up with \u2013 loneliness. Let's listen to Professor Dorret Boomsma at the Vrije University in Amsterdam talking about this.</p>, <p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Professor Dorret Boomsma, Department of Biological Psychology at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam<br/></strong>So the intriguing question is why do genes that influence loneliness still exist? And one explanation is that probably they do not only have negative effects. In some situations it is an advantage to be able to tolerate high levels of loneliness and that is why the genes are maintained in the population.</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>So, inheriting genes for loneliness might not be a bad thing. Why's that, Neil?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Because it means you can tolerate being alone for a long time without feeling bad.</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Well, that's an <strong>intriguing</strong> \u2013 or very interesting \u2013 idea. But it shows that you probably don't have those genes, Neil, because you did feel bad at the weekend.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>That's true. And actually, that was despite spending a long time on Facebook, and that's a form of social contact. But does all the tweeting, messaging, and chatting online that we do make us lonelier, because we're getting out less and meeting fewer people? Or do virtual connections stop us from feeling lonely?</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Those are also intriguing questions. Let's listen to Professor Eric Klinenberg sociologist at New York University and author of a book about living alone. He talks about this.</p>, <p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Eric Klinenberg, sociologist at New York University and author<br/></strong>We just don't have great research showing that we are significantly more lonely or isolated today than we were ten or twenty or thirty years ago, which means critics who say that Facebook or the internet or whatever device you carry with you, is making you lonelier and more miserable - they just don't have that much evidence to back it up.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So there isn't enough evidence to <strong>back up</strong> \u2013 or support \u2013 the claim that social media is making us feel lonelier.</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>No, there isn't. OK, now before I give you the answer to today's quiz question, Neil, did you know that loneliness is <strong>contagious</strong>?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>You mean you can catch it from somebody like a cold?</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Yes. There are environmental factors involved in loneliness too. For example, if somebody you talk to every day is always unfriendly towards you, this makes you statistically more likely to be negative in your interactions with somebody else.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, let's try and stay friendly towards each other, then, Sophie. You can start by telling me whether I got today's quiz question right!</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>OK. I asked: which country has the highest proportion of people living on their own? Is it \u2026 a) the US, b) Japan or c) Sweden?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I said Japan.</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>This is the wrong answer, I'm afraid. It's actually c) Sweden. Nearly half of all Swedish households are <strong>single-occupancy</strong> \u2013 or for one person. Living alone in Sweden is arguably the norm because it's so easy \u2013 there are many affordable single-occupancy apartments and young Swedes can expect to move into their own apartment once they graduate high-school.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>OK, now let's hear the words we learned today again, Sophie.</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Yes, OK. They are:<br/>down in the dumps<br/>loneliness<br/>isolated<br/>cooperation<br/>tolerate<br/>intriguing<br/>back up<br/>contagious<br/>single occupancy</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, that's the end of this edition of 6 Minute English.

I'm Alice\u2026</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I'm Neil. So, Alice, what do you see when you look at me?</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well, male, Caucasian, early 40s, short auburn hair, bushy eyebrows, thin lips...\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>OK. So that's how you see me? It sounds like a police report, and I'm not sure I like your observation about thin lips. <strong>Caucasian</strong> means white skinned and European, by the way.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>And today the show is about <strong>identity</strong> \u2013 who or what a person is. And the way people see us forms part of our sense of identity, while another part comes from our <strong>ethnic</strong> \u2013 or racial \u2013 identity. So my question for you today, Neil, is: \u00a0What percentage of the UK population describe themselves as ethnically mixed? Is it \u2026<br/>a) 0.9%?<br/>b) 5.9%?<br/>Or c) 9%?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>OK\u2026 I think that it's a) 0.9%.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well, we'll find out if you got the answer right or wrong later on in the show. Now, Neil, you are, of course, many more things than my physical description of you!</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I'm glad to hear that. And it's true, that until you actually hear somebody speak, there are lots of things you can't know about them. For example, which country they're from, what language they speak\u2026</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Yes. So looking at me, what would you say, Neil?\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I would say Alice that you're a typical English rose.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Thanks, Neil \u2013 and <strong>English rose</strong> describes an attractive girl with a pale delicate <strong>complexion</strong> \u2013 or skin colour \u2013 but you can't actually tell where a person is from by the way they look.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, I suppose you're right. I have a friend who also looks very English like you, but she's a real ethnic mix. Her dad is German and her mum is Brazilian!</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well, let's hear from New York City actress and playwright, Sarah Jones, talking about her complicated ethnicity.</p>, <p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Sarah Jones, actress and playwright, New York City<br/></strong>My family on my dad's side, my grandparents, are from the South. There's some Caribbean in there, black Americans from the South and the Caribbean, and then on my mother's side there are people from the Caribbean, from Ireland but you know Irish American, German American. People would ask me if I was adopted when they saw my mother's white skin - she's actually mixed but she's white from a distance, and I'm black from a distance.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Sarah Jones there. Well, Sarah has family from all over the world! I suppose the United States - and New York City, especially - is a real melting pot.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>That's right. And <strong>melting pot</strong> describes a society made from people of different countries who live together and create a new shared culture.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And people think Sarah is <strong>adopted</strong> \u2013 or raised by parents who aren't biologically hers \u2013 because she looks so different to her mum.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>But I expect Sarah sees herself as American. New York is where she was born and raised.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>That's right. But her grandparents weren't. Do you think you change when you go and live in another country with people different to you?</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Yes, I do. My neighbours are Turkish but they've lived in England for 45 years so they\u2019ve integrated into our culture. They enjoy English things like\u2026 our TV soap operas, cooking turkey at Christmas, and drinking tea with milk.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And to <strong>integrate</strong> means to join a group of people, and often involves changing your habits and customs.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Yes. OK. So, Neil, to what extent does the way other people see us, actually change us? Let's listen to Julian Baggini, a writer and philosopher here in the UK and find out what he thinks.</p>, <p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Julian Baggini, writer and philosopher, UK<br/></strong>It seems very evident that our sense of self isn't something that comes entirely from within. And of course we're affected by the way other people see us. And that's one of the most formative things in creating our sense of identity. I mean, I think it's kind of a two-way process that's ongoing. Our sense of who we are is always a response in part to how other people see us.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So Julian Baggini believes the way other people see us is <strong>formative</strong> in creating our sense of identity \u2013 or who we are. And formative means important for the development of something.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>So if enough people see you as an English rose, you might start to see yourself as an English rose, even if you aren't ethnically English.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I'm not so sure. The friend I talked about earlier, she comes across as much more Brazilian than English in the way she behaves. She doesn't have the famous English reserve \u2013 but you'd never know it by looking at her.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>And <strong>reserve</strong> means hiding what you're thinking or feeling. I think I'm guilty of English reserve. How about you, Neil?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>No, I think I <strong>wear my heart on my sleeve</strong>, Alice \u2013 which means I make my feelings clear. OK, I think it's time for the answer to today's quiz question.<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Okey-dokey, fair enough. I asked you: What percentage of the UK population described themselves as ethnically mixed? Is it \u2026 a) 0.9%, b) 5.9% or c) 9%?<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I said a) 0.9%.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Yes. And you were on the money today, Neil! Well done! According to a survey conducted by the BBC in 2011, when asked about their own ethnic origins, 0.9% of the UK population said they were mixed race, although it's thought that the real figure is 2% or more. Now, could you remind us of the words we heard today, Neil?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Sure. They are:<br/>Caucasian<br/>identity<br/>ethnic<br/>English rose<br/>complexion<br/>melting pot<br/>adopted<br/>integrate<br/>formative<br/>reserve<br/>wear your heart on your sleeve\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>And that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

I'm Alice\u2026<strong>\u00a0</strong></p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>And I'm Neil.\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>So, Neil, you texted me earlier and didn't put a full stop at the end.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>You're right, I never use full stops in texts \u2013 they're much too <strong>stuffy</strong> \u2013 or formal. Texting is like conversation and you don't need lots of punctuation.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well, punctuation is the subject of today's show. And I know I'm a bit of a stickler about this, but I think you're letting the standards of written English language slip. <strong>\u00a0</strong>\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>A <strong>stickler</strong> is someone who insists on a certain way of doing a particular thing.Surely you aren't such a stickler for punctuation rules that you want to stop the evolution of English, Alice?\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>No, of course not, but I am a stickler when people don't follow the rules of punctuation because this makes written text ambiguous or difficult to understand.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong><strong>Ambiguous</strong> means when something has two or more meanings. Can you give me some examples of punctuation making text easier to understand?</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Alright then, here you are: Let's eat Grandma.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Ugh! It brings to mind the children's story Little Red Riding Hood, about a girl, her grandmother and a hungry wolf. Is that the wolf talking to another wolf friend of his?</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>No, it's the girl, Red Riding Hood, talking to her grandmother. And with a well-placed comma it becomes: Let's eat, Grandma. Without proper punctuation the sentence is ambiguous. Now, before we look at more reasons why punctuation is important, let's have today's quiz question.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>OK. What is another word for the keyboard sign that represents a paragraph? Is it\u2026<br/>a) pilcrow?<br/>b) bodkin?<br/>or c) pica?</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>I'll say c) pica.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, we'll find out later in the show if you got that right or not.\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Moving on now, punctuation was invented by the Ancient Greeks. They used a series of dots to indicate different lengths of pauses. A short unit of text was a comma, a longer unit was a colon, and a complete sentence was a periodos. We used these terms to name our punctuation marks \u2013 although they actually refer to the clauses not to the dots themselves.<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So early punctuation wasn't about grammar, then?</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>No, it was about public speaking. The different dots indicated different lengths of pauses: short, medium, and long. These pauses broke the text up so it was easier to read and therefore easier to understand.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>OK, let's hear from the punctuation expert, Keith Houston, who is author of <em>Shady Characters: Ampersands, Interrobangs and Other Typographical Curiosities. </em>Here he's talking on BBC Radio 4's programme Word of Mouth<em>.</em></p>, <p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Keith Houston, author of <em>Shady Characters: Ampersands, Interrobangs and Other Typographical Curiosities<br/></em></strong>Punctuation started off being all about rhetoric \u2013 about speech \u2013 but we started to assign rules, I think around about the 8th century or so. We started to associate the marks, not just with pauses, but with the actual grammatical units that were used to punctuate. So, a comma wasn't just a dot that meant, pause for this length of time. It now actually marked out a clause, you know, it marked out a sort of consistent logical bit of writing.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>So <strong>rhetoric</strong> \u2013 or the art of persuasive speaking \u2013 was very important to the Greeks and to the Romans. And to be persuasive, you need to be understood. And these little punctuation marks helped the speaker to deliver their text more effectively.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Later on, these marks were given grammatical functions. The comma marks out a <strong>clause</strong> \u2013 or grammatical unit containing a subject and a verb \u2013 as well as telling the reader to pause briefly.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Are you beginning to see why being <strong>sloppy</strong> \u2013 or careless \u2013 with punctuation isn't a good thing, Neil?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, I am. Though recent research into texting and punctuation suggests that people consider messages ending in full stops to be less sincere than ones without.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Really? Well, now might be a good time to hear about how it can be hard to make writing unambiguous. We can misinterpret the written word, even with punctuation to guide us. Here's Keith Houston again, talking to Michael Rosen, presenter of Word of Mouth.</p>, <p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Michael Rosen and Keith Houston<br/></strong>MR: Quite often I notice on Twitter and places like that people misunderstand irony. I mean because we only have text in front of us not intonation. So do we need an irony punctuation \u2013'hello, I'm being ironic now' \u2013 do we need that?<br/>KH: You might say that emoticons are the best way to go about that \u2013 a little winking emoticon \u2013 you know, semicolon, dash, closing parenthesis.<br/>MR: Oh yes, yes, of course - they've invented all these with the punctuation that we have on the keyboard.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong><strong>Irony</strong> means using words to mean something that is the opposite of its <strong>literal</strong> \u2013 or most usual \u2013 meaning. But when we're online \u2013 using email or Twitter \u2013 you don't hear the words, and that's why it can be hard to know what feelings the writer intended.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>That's right. When we use <strong>emoticons</strong> \u2013 facial expressions made out of keyboard characters \u2013 we can signpost the feelings we intend.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Now, Alice, remember I asked you: What is another word for the keyboard sign that represents a paragraph? Is it a) pilcrow, b) bodkin or c) pica?</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Yes, I said pica.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And you were wrong, I'm afraid. The right answer is pilcrow, which comes from the Greek word 'paragraphos'. The earliest reference of the modern 'pilcrow' is from 1440 with the Middle English word 'pylcrafte'.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Oh dear, sad face. I hate it when I get the quiz question wrong. Now, can we hear the words we learned today?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, they are:<br/>stuffy<br/>stickler<br/>rhetoric<br/>clause<br/>sloppy<br/>irony<br/>literal<br/>emoticons</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

[rattles a bottle of pills]</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>What have you got there, Neil?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Antibiotics. I had a blister on my big toe, and it got infected. My whole toe swelled up like a balloon! The swelling has gone down now with these little wonder drugs. Look, I'll show you.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>No, Neil. Please keep your socks on. Thank you. Now, the subject of today's show is penicillin, which was one of the first antibiotics to be discovered. So, Neil, can you tell me how many lives penicillin has saved since its first use as a medicine in 1942? Is it\u2026<br/>a) 20 million?<br/>b) 200 million?<br/>Or c) 2 billion?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, I'll say b) 200 million. That sounds like a good number.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>OK, well, we'll see if you're right or wrong later on in the show. Now, penicillin is a common <strong>antibiotic</strong> \u2013 or substance that kills microorganisms \u2013 that acts very effectively against certain bacteria. And it was discovered in 1928 by a Scottish scientist called Alexander Fleming who noticed some mould growing on a petri dish of bacteria in his lab, which had a <strong>halo</strong> \u2013 or circle \u2013 around it where no bacteria were growing.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong><strong>Mould</strong>, by the way, is the soft green fuzzy stuff that grows\u2026 for example, in the bottom of my coffee cups when I forget to wash them up, Alice.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>We didn't need to know that, Neil.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>OK, well, moving on, it took decades before scientists learned how to successfully manufacture penicillin. But they got there just in time to treat huge numbers of soldiers in World War Two where so many men were dying from infected wounds.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>And you could have died from your infected toe, Neil, before penicillin!</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>That is a sobering thought, isn't it Alice? Let\u2019s listen now to <span>Christopher Tang, Professor of Cellular Pathology at the University of Oxford, talking about how penicillin has been a game changer in the field of medicine.</span></p>, <p><strong>INSERT<br/> </strong><strong><span>Christopher Tang, Professor of Cellular Pathology and Professorial Fellow at Exeter College, University of Oxford<br/></span></strong><span>The sort of cancer chemotherapy which we currently use, which immunosuppress people, we couldn't possibly consider that without the use of antibiotics. So not only has penicillin opened the door for treating people with infection, it's also essentially paved the way for modern medicine, modern interventional medicine that we benefit from now.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><strong><span>Chemotherapy</span></strong><span> is a chemical treatment used to kill cancer cells that also <strong>suppresses</strong></span><span> \u2013 or stops \u2013 the body's immune system from working. The </span><strong><span>immune system </span></strong><span>is our body's defence against infection and disease. So cancer patients have to take antibiotics to prevent infections that the body can't fight off by itself.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>So the discovery of penicillin paved the way for chemotherapy and other types of medical treatment \u2013 and to <strong>pave the way</strong></span><span> means to make something possible. </span>But surely, Alice, there are some bacteria that penicillin doesn't kill?</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>You're right. It only works against bacteria with proteins that are sensitive to penicillin. Other types are less sensitive, and also have systems built into the structure of the cell that sweep out harmful compounds, such as penicillin.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And what about that superbug, what's it called\u2026 MS\u2026 MR\u2026MSR\u2026?</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>MRSA, Neil. This bacterium was sensitive to penicillin but has developed a <strong>resistance</strong> to it, and to other antibiotics, meaning the drugs can't harm it any more.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Are we returning to the past, then, Alice, where people like me might die from an infected toe?</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well, it's possible, Neil. But drug-resistance isn't new. Here's Professor Steve Jones to tell us more.</p>, <p><strong><span>INSERT<br/></span></strong><strong><span>Steve Jones, Emeritus Professor of Genetics, University College, London<br/></span></strong><span>Penicillin is not new. It's been around for millions, probably hundreds of millions of years in the soil. And it's because the moulds protect themselves with it. And in fact you find resistance to penicillin in the most unlikely places. You find it for example in corpses from before Columbus in the New World. </span></p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Professor Steve Jones. So penicillin was discovered in 1928 but it's actually been around for hundreds of millions of years.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Yes. And scientists have been able to test bacteria present in very old <strong>corpses</strong> \u2013 or dead bodies \u2013 discovered in the New World \u2013 that's North and South America \u2013 and found that some of it was resistant to penicillin.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>But penicillin resistance is growing, isn't it?</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Yes. These days we overuse penicillin both in agriculture and human medicine, which has given bacteria the chance to adapt and fight back. So it's now up to scientists to adapt penicillin to extend its lifespan, and to search for new types of antibiotics.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>But prevention is better than cure, isn't it? We should all wash our hands more \u2013 it's a fantastic way of killing bacteria.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Yes. Good point, Neil, but washing your hands didn't cure your toe, did it? Now, remember I asked you earlier: How many lives has penicillin saved since its first use as a medicine in 1942? Was it\u2026 a) 20 million, b) 200 million or c) 2 billion?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I said b) 200 million.<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>And you were right! Penicillin became the most effective life-saving drug in the world, conquering diseases such as tuberculosis, gangrene, pneumonia, diphtheria, and scarlet fever and made Alexander Fleming an international hero for discovering it.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Now, let's hear the words we learned today.<br/>They are:<br/>antibiotic<br/>halo<br/>mould<br/>chemotherapy<br/>suppresses<br/>immune system<br/>pave the way<br/>resistance<br/>corpses</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

I'm Alice\u2026</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span><span> </span></strong><span>And I'm Neil. I'm feeling a bit chilly today, Alice. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, it is <strong>unseasonably</strong></span><span> cold today \u2013 which means not normal for the time of year. But the weather is very unpredictable these days. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>I know what you mean. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Well, global warming is the subject of today's show. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Is global warming really something to worry about? Some people say that the Earth has warmed up in the past and nothing terrible has happened. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>The Earth has warmed up before, but this was the result of things like wobbles in the Earth's orbit, not because of an increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Can we reverse the changes? </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>No, it's too late, and now we have to find ways to adapt to extreme weather, rising sea levels, and melting polar ice caps. However, we can <strong>mitigate</strong></span><span> greenhouse gas emissions \u2013 or make them less harmful. But before we talk more about this, I have a question for you. How much has the average temperature of the Earth's surface increased in the last hundred years? Is it\u2026<br/></span><span>a) 0.85\u00b0C?<br/></span><span>b) 1.85\u00b0C?<br/></span><span>Or c) 8.5\u00b0C?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>I'm gonna go for the big one a) 8.5\u00b0C.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Well, we'll find out if you got the answer right later on, Neil. But first, do you know any ways to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions?</span></p>, <p><span> </span><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>I do, actually. An Argentinian company has started collecting cow\u2026 emissions and converting them into usable energy.</span></p>, <p><span> </span><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Well, as the world eats more meat, methane emissions from livestock are actually becoming a bigger climate concern.</span></p>, <p><span> </span><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And one day's worth of cow emissions provides energy to run a car for 24 hours.</span></p>, <p><span> </span><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>OK, moving on now, so the world is going to have to adapt to global warming since we can't turn back the clock on climate change. And rich countries have the resources to do this, whilst poorer countries don't. Let's hear from Saleemul Huq, Director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development in Bangladesh, talking about how this problem is being addressed.</span></p>, <p><span> </span><strong><span>INSERT<br/></span><span> </span></strong><strong><span>Saleemul Huq, Director, International Centre for Climate Change and Development in Bangladesh<br/></span></strong><span>Saleemul Huq: The rich countries have already pledged and promised a hundred billion dollars a year, starting from 2020, to cover all kinds of climate change activities which in climate change are either going to be called mitigation or adaptation.<br/></span><span>Owen Bennett Jones: A year? But that's an enormous sum of money!<br/></span><span>Saleemul Huq: Not that enormous compared to what they gave to the banking system when it collapsed. Climate change is a much bigger problem than the banking crisis.</span></p>, <p><span> </span><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Saleemul Huq interviewed on the BBC World Service programme Newshour Extra. Well, he says rich countries have <strong>pledged</strong></span><span> \u2013 or promised \u2013 to deliver a hundred billion dollars a year to help poorer countries adapt to climate change. However, he suggests that this sum could have been larger \u2013 since more money than this was donated to resolve the banking crisis.</span></p>, <p><span> </span><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>For example, after the devastating effects of Hurricane Sandy, New York City invested ten billion dollars on storm defences to protect Manhattan \u2013 and Wall Street. </span></p>, <p><span> </span><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And where lack of water is a problem, countries like Australia, China, and Spain, have built <strong>desalination</strong></span><span> plants, which remove the salt from seawater to produce drinking water. But it's too expensive for developing countries to do this, even though they need them. </span></p>, <p><span> </span><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>So in relative terms, one billion dollars a year to help poor countries is a small sum of money when compared to their need. Countries like Bangladesh have developed <strong>homegrown</strong></span><span> technologies \u2013 which means produced locally \u2013 such as harvesting rainwater from their rooftops. </span></p>, <p><span> </span><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>OK, Alice, and thinking about certain radical proposals for adaptation \u2013 did you know there's a Dutch company that wants to build floating cities for us to live in? </span></p>, <p><span> </span><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>No, I didn't.</span></p>, <p><span> </span><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yeah. Plans include 15-storey high-rise buildings and floating food production. </span></p>, <p><span> </span><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>It sounds like it would be incredibly expensive. Has anyone actually built one?</span></p>, <p><span> </span><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>No, not so far. Let's hear from <span>Mark Maslin, Professor of Climatology at University College London,</span></span><span> talking about why this might be.</span></p>, <p><span> </span><strong><span>INSERT<br/></span><span> </span></strong><strong><span>Mark Maslin, Professor of Climatology at University College London<br/></span></strong><span>Remember, we're going to have 9.5 billion people by the middle of this century. Now, if you think about it, think about the logistics of building a city, floating, for say, ten million people. And then multiply that up to 60 per cent of 9.5 billion people. OK? So don't think it's really cost-efficient.</span></p>, <p><span> </span><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>So in practical terms, the logistics of building a large floating city probably couldn't work. It wouldn't be <strong>cost-efficient </strong></span><span>\u2013 or good value for the money you paid. </span></p>, <p><span> </span><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>And <strong>logistics</strong></span><span> means the organization of a complex activity.</span></p>, <p><span> </span><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>On the other hand, the logistics of teaching farmers in Bangladesh to breed ducks instead of chickens, for example, would be relatively simple and cost-efficient \u2013 and since ducks float and chickens don't, it's a sensible adaptation to climate change! </span></p>, <p><span> </span><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>That's a great example, Neil! Now, I think it's time for the answer to today's quiz question. I asked: How much has the average temperature of the Earth's surface increased in the last hundred years? Is it\u2026 a) 0.85\u00b0C, b) 1.85\u00b0C or c) 8.5\u00b0C?</span></p>, <p><span> </span><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And I said c) 8.5\u00b0C and I know I'm wrong.</span></p>, <p><span> </span><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, I'm afraid you are Neil. The right answer is actually 0.85\u00b0C.

I'm Alice\u2026</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>And I'm Neil.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>We\u2019re talking about old technology today, Neil. Did you use to have any old tech, you know, a Walkman, back in the 1990s? Before music went digital?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>No. I didn't have a Walkman\u2026 But I do have a record player.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>I know you like flared trousers, but I didn't realize you were that retro. A <strong>record player</strong>, for those of you who don\u2019t know, is a box with a <strong>turntable</strong> \u2013 or turning plate that you put your vinyl records on to play them.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And <strong>retro</strong> means going back to styles and fashions from the past. Well, I love my record player. I have a large collection of vinyl records, as well as cassette tapes that I inherited from my parents\u2026</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong><strong>Vinyl</strong> is the plastic that records are made from. And <strong>cassette tapes</strong> came after records \u2013 which are these small plastic cases with audiotape on reels inside them. Well, I don't understand your fondness for out-dated stuff, Neil.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Don't be so quick to dismiss old tech, Alice. There's been a <strong>resurgence</strong> \u2013 or new rise in \u2013 record sales recently \u2013 here in the UK, and in the US. Some DJs have gone back to using them, and new record stores have opened to meet the demand for vinyl.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Really?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, really. In fact, I have a question for you, Alice: How many records were sold in the UK in 2014? Was it\u2026<br/>a) 10,000?<br/>b) 100,000?<br/>Or c) 1 million?</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well, I think it\u2019s b) 100,000.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>We'll find out if you're right or wrong later in the show. For myself, I just think vinyl sounds nicer than digital \u2013 has a warmer quality.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>That sounds a bit technical, Neil! Don't you think this retro trend has more to do with nostalgia for the past?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong><strong>Nostalgia</strong> means thinking about the past with a mixture of warm feelings and sadness. Well, yes, I think people who grew up with the old technology probably are nostalgic about it. Let's listen to music journalist Jacqueline Springer talking about cassette tapes and what they mean to her.</p>, <p><strong>INSERT<br/> </strong><strong><span>Jacqueline Springer, music journalist<br/></span></strong><span>They were audio love letters. They were ways in which you started to carve out your own identity so you know when Dan or I have interviewed people we talk about\u2026 we talk to musicians about their impressions and, you know, and their influences, and invariably it was siblings or parents. And you would raid those vinyl albums and you would self-select.</span></p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Jacqueline Springer there. So she calls cassette tapes 'audio love letters' \u2013 because people often <strong>compiled</strong> \u2013 or put together \u2013 their own collection of songs on tapes and gave them to the boy or girl they liked.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Jacqueline says they recorded songs from their parents' record collections onto tape. And it seems that this process helped create their musical and social identity.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes. I identified with The Rolling Stones, The Clash, and The Sex Pistols when I was a teen. How about your musical identity, Alice?</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well, I was in love with all the boy bands from the 1990s \u2013 NSync, Westlife, Backstreet Boys, Take That.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Unbelievable. I can see I need to make you some decent tapes of music from the 90s, Alice.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>I didn\u2019t say I still like boy bands, Neil. I'm not nostalgic for my lost teenage years \u2013 unlike you.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Old tech is everywhere. Did you know that the US nuclear weapons force still uses a computer system dating back to the 1970s with 8-inch floppy disks?</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong><strong>Floppy disks</strong>? You mean those flexible plastic computer disks used for storing data magnetically. Well, I can't believe the guys in The Pentagon are nostalgic about floppy disks.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, a Pentagon spokesperson said it would be extremely expensive to update the system and it still works. They plan to do it by 2020 and save a lot of space for sure. You would need more than 130,000 8-inch floppy disks to store 32GB of information.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Wow! This is the equivalent of an average memory stick!<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes. But there are more people out there keen on old tech. How do you think a DVD rental store survives in this era of online movie streaming? Let's listen to Tara Judah, co-director of UK rental store 20th Century Flicks and find out.</p>, <p><strong>INSERT<br/> </strong><strong><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">Tara Judah, Co-director, 20<sup>th</sup></span><span data-mce-mark=\"1\"> Century Flicks<br/></span></strong><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">We've survived because of the experience of coming into this store. Um\u2026 It's a very human experience. It's human interaction. People come here because they want to talk to somebody who's really knowledgeable about film. They want to have a recommendation or a conversation about the films they just watch. You know, they really want to discuss those things.</span></p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So it's back to the idea of human contact \u2013 we like compiling lists of music and sharing them with our friends and loved ones. Sharing a playlist through iTunes or Spotify isn't quite the same, though. We like talking people about the films we watch.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>You can always talk to me, Neil. Now how about giving me the answer to today's quiz question?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I asked: How many records were sold in the UK in 2014? Was it\u2026 a) 10,000 b) 100,000? Or c) 1 million?</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>I said b) 100,000.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And, Alice, you were in fact totally wrong! The answer is c). Vinyl is booming \u2013 in 2014, sales passed 1million albums in the UK for the first time since 1996. The format has been steadily increasing, thanks in part to the popularity of guitar bands, traditionally associated with records.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Now let's hear words we learned today.<br/>They are:<br/>record player<br/>turntable<br/>retro<br/>vinyl<br/>cassette tapes<br/>resurgence<br/>nostalgia<br/>compiled<br/>floppy disk</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

I'm Alice\u2026</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>And I'm Neil.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Could you lend me some dosh, Neil?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Sure. How much do you need?</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>A couple of smackers.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>You're sounding strange today, Alice.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Yes, I know, Neil. <strong>Slang</strong> \u2013 or informal language used by a particular group \u2013 is the subject of today's show, and I was just demonstrating a couple of slang words that mean 'money'. <strong>Dosh</strong> is a general term for money and a <strong>smacker</strong> is a British pound or US dollar.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>OK, so <strong>Cockney Rhyming Slang</strong> is a type of slang. It's a coded language invented in the 19th Century by Cockneys so they could speak in front of the police without being understood. And still on the subject of money, I have a question for you, Alice.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>OK.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>What's Cockney Rhyming Slang for 'money'? Is it\u2026<br/>a) bread?<br/>b) honey?<br/>Or c) dough?</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>I think it's a) bread. I bet you didn't know, Neil, that I'm a Cockney.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I don't Adam and Eve it, Alice! That's a pork pie!</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>'Adam and Eve' means 'believe' and 'pork pie' means\u2026 'lie'! Actually, you're right. I'm not a Cockney.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>To be considered a Cockney, you need to be born within hearing distance of the bells of St Mary-le-Bow church in what is now the City of London.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Indeed. Now, slang, as we've said, is <strong>colloquial</strong> \u2013 or informal \u2013 language. And it's characteristic of specific social groups. We usually use it in informal conversation rather than in writing or more formal situations, like a job interview.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>We change the way we speak so that what we say is appropriate for a particular situation. So you surprised me, earlier, Alice, by talking about 'dosh' and 'smackers' because it didn't seem appropriate for presenting the show.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Slang use is often <strong>frowned upon</strong> \u2013 or disapproved of. Let's listen to Jonathan Green, a lexicographer of slang, talking about who uses slang and how this has changed. Here he is on the Radio 4 programme Word of Mouth.</p>, <p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Jonathan Green, lexicographer of slang<br/></strong>Slang does have a bad reputation and I would say this comes from its earliest collection, which was of criminal slang in the 1500s in the 16th century, and it was associated with bad people, and inevitably that has lingered. But now in the last 40 or 50 years it's changed. The definitions tend to stress 'different' and 'jocular', 'funny', 'humorous', 'inventive', that kind of thing.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So we have records of 16th Century slang in collections \u2013 or dictionaries. Words used by criminals as a code so they could talk without being understood. And this bad reputation has <strong>lingered</strong> \u2013 or been slow to disappear.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>But for the last 50 years we've been using slang to be funny and creative as well as to show belonging to a particular group. And apparently we're very creative when talking about drinking and being drunk. The slang word <strong>booze</strong> \u2013 meaning 'alcohol' \u2013 comes from the 13th Century Dutch word, 'b\u016bsen'.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And there are hundreds of slang expressions to talk about drink and being drunk: 'on the sauce', 'in your cups', 'half cut', 'hammered', 'squiffy', 'tipsy', 'wasted', 'legless', and many many more that are far too rude to mention in this programme.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Yes. So, while these terms might not be strictly acceptable \u2013 or appropriate in formal contexts they aren't offensive, they are often amusing and help people bond in social groups.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>By contrast, <strong>swear</strong> words or <strong>profanity</strong> \u2013 means 'rude language that offends or upsets people'. And I'm not going to give any examples because that would be inappropriate and impolite, Alice.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>OK, let's listen now to Jonathan Green and presenter Michael Rosen talking about jargon \u2013 another type of in-group language.</p>, <p><strong>INSERT<br/> </strong><strong>Jonathan Green, lexicographer of slang, and Michael Rosen, Presenter, Word of Mouth, Radio 4<br/></strong>JG: Jargon is what I would call is small 'o' occupational, small 'p' professional. It's closed off environments. You get legal jargon, you get naval jargon, I've been reading Patrick O'Brien recently and that's awash with futtock plates and fiddying the decks.<br/>MR: This is radio 4 Jonathan, be careful!</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Jonathan Green in another segment of the BBC Radio 4 programme Word of Mouth. So he says jargon is occupational and professional, meaning people speak it at work, for example, lawyers and sailors. A futtock plate is, I believe, an iron plate attached to the top of a ship's mast. But I don't know much about this subject.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>That's the idea, though \u2013 <strong>jargon</strong> is the technical language belonging to a specific group. And to <strong>outsiders</strong> this jargon is often hard to understand.<br/>\u00a0<br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes and here in the studio I can use all the radio jargon that I like. Look at my faders here, Alice. Going down and up and up and I'm just testing our levels\u2026</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Come on, live the fader alone. It controls the level of sound on a studio deck. Now it's time for the answer to today's quiz question, Neil.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I asked you: What's Cockney Rhyming Slang for money? Is it\u2026 a) bread, b) honey or c) dough?</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>And I said a) bread.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And you were right, Alice! Cockney Rhyming Slang uses just the first word of a phrase that rhymes with a word we're trying to disguise. So 'money' becomes 'bread and honey' but we just say 'bread'.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>OK, so let's recap on the words we've learned today. They are:<br/>slang<br/>dosh<br/>smacker<br/>Cockney Rhyming Slang<br/>colloquial<br/>frowned upon<br/>lingered<br/>booze<br/>swear<br/>profanity<br/>jargon</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

And you know what? I'm not very good at them. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><strong><span>Domestic</span></strong><span> means to do with the family or home and a <strong>chore</strong></span><span> is a boring job that needs doing. Not being good at chores sounds like a bad excuse for avoiding housework, Neil. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>I suppose you're right. But I wasn't surprised to learn that on average women spend several more hours a day doing chores at home than men. Maybe men have a higher threshold for dirt and untidiness. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Do you have a high threshold, Neil?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yes. And <strong>threshold</strong></span><span> means the point at which you begin to feel something. It takes a lot of dirt and untidiness to make me feel I need to start clearing up.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>OK, so my question for you today, Neil, is: What percentage of men take responsibility for giving the house a weekly clean, according to a recent online survey by the UK organization, Mumsnet? Is it\u2026<br/></span><span>a) 1%?<br/></span><span>b) 5%?<br/></span><span>Or c) 10%?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Hmm. Those figures all sound low. But I'll assume that not all men are like me, and say c) 10%.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Well, we'll see if you're being optimistic with your answer later on in the show. So now let's listen to a conversation between BBC reporter Geoff Byrd and his wife Sarah. In an interview to a BBC presenter they discuss Sarah's <strong>aversion </strong>to</span><span> \u2013 or strong dislike of domestic chores.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>INSERT<br/></span><span> BBC reporter Geoff Byrd and his wife Sarah<br/></span></strong><span>SB: The thing is, it's a boring thing. You should just do the minimum amount you need to do to get by. That is my policy. I would say I definitely work harder than you do, and therefore have less time. Have we just switched round in terms of our roles?<br/></span><span>GB: Probably. Yeah. And that's no bad thing. Go the revolution!</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Sarah and Geoff there. In their household, Geoff does more chores because Sarah finds them boring and she also does more paid work. She thinks people should do the <strong>minimum</strong></span><span> amount of housework \u2013 or least amount needed \u2013 to get by. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>And <strong>to</strong></span><span> </span><strong><span>get by</span></strong><span> means to achieve something with difficulty. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>So Geoff does most of the cooking and cleaning in their house \u2013 which as we discussed earlier on, isn't usually the case for men. He doesn't seem to mind, though, does he?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>That's right. He says switching roles is <strong>no bad thing</strong></span><span> \u2013 in other words, it's a good thing!</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yey. Go the revolution! Just don't include me, because I'm with Sarah. I hate housework.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>OK, well let's assume that Sarah and Geoff aren't typical of most families, and consider the serious implications of women doing more of the household chores. Some domestic tasks can be strongly <strong>gendered</strong></span><span> \u2013 or specific to one sex. For example, doing the laundry, organizing your children's school and social lives are often jobs that women do.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>But putting the rubbish out or fixing a leaky tap \u2013 those are work many people still see as men's jobs.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Well, I put the rubbish bins out in my household, Neil. Anyway, this means women often spend significantly more time doing chores at home, juggling this with paid work.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, that sounds like a lot. I can see I'm going to have to get my pinny on a bit more at home, Alice.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>I hope you do, Neil, because a bit more give and take at home could help improve a working mum's prospects of getting promoted at work and earning more. And for those of you unfamiliar with the word,<strong> pinny</strong></span><span> \u2013 or </span><strong><span>pinafore</span></strong><span> \u2013 means apron.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And<strong> give and take</strong></span><span> means compromise.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Let's hear now from Professor Jonathan Gershuny, co-director at the Centre for Time Use Research at Oxford University, talking about why it's important to protect your <strong>earning capacity</strong></span><span> \u2013 or ability to earn money.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>INSERT<br/></span><span> Professor Jonathan Gershuny, co-director at the Centre for Time Use Research at Oxford University<br/></span></strong><span>Nowadays, half of all marriages fail\u2026 you know\u2026 it's not a reasonable expectation that you're going to stay married to the same chap indefinitely. And if under these circumstances you've been out of the labour force looking after the kids while he builds up his earnings capacity by working long hours at work and then he runs off with his secretary, well he departs with his earnings power, and you're left with the baby.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Professor Jonathan Gershuny. But actually, these days, quite a few men take care of the children while their wives or partners work full time. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>And she might run off with her secretary. But the main issue here is that both partners \u2013 whether male or female \u2013 should protect their earnings capacity. Now, I think it's time for the answer to today's quiz question, Neil. I asked you: What percentage of men take responsibility for giving the house a weekly clean, according to a recent online survey by the UK organization, Mumsnet? Is it\u2026 a) 1%, b) 5% or c) 10%?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>I said c) 10%. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>And you were wrong, I'm afraid, Neil! The answer is actually b) 5%.

I'm Alice\u2026</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span><span> </span></strong><span>And I'm Neil. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>What are you eating, Neil? </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>It's a chocolate chip muffin.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>How many calories do you think it contains?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>I have no idea.<br/><br/></span><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Check the packet.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>It's hard to find the calorie content amongst all the other information here. Ah, here we go: 450. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>That's a lot! Are you sure you should be eating that? </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Why not? I expect I cycled off quite a few calories on the way to work.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Well, that depends on the length of your journey and how much energy you <strong>expended</strong></span><span> \u2013 or used up. Now, on today's show we're talking about food and the exercise it takes to burn off calories. And I have a question for you, Neil: How long would you have to walk to burn off the calories in a quarter of a large pizza? Is it\u2026<br/></span><span>a) 33 minutes?<br/></span><span>b) 53 minutes?<br/></span><span>c) 83 minutes?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>I'll go for a) 33 minutes. That sounds quite enough considering if you ate the whole pizza it would mean walking for 132 minutes to <strong>burn off</strong></span><span> \u2013 or use \u2013 the calories. And that's over two hours!</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Well, we'll find out later on whether you got the answer right or not, Neil. But be warned \u2013 people are bad at estimating how many calories there are in food. Now, the Royal Society for Public Health here in the UK is concerned that people don't read the information on food packaging because the text is so <strong>dense</strong></span><span> \u2013 it means, tightly packed. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, I never look at food labelling when I'm shopping for food. How about you, Alice? </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Well, personally, I like to make an informed choice about what I put in my body, Neil! And <strong>informed</strong></span><span> means based on an understanding of the facts. So I spend a lot of time reading the packaging. And I think the current traffic lights are a great idea.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Traffic lights? What are you talking about?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>It's where food content is colour-coded red, orange or green \u2013 like traffic lights \u2013 depending on its percentage of fat, sugar, and salt. So you can see at a glance which pizza on the supermarket shelf is better for you. This helps the consumer to make an informed choice.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>To <strong>see at a glance</strong></span><span> means to understand something immediately. Well, my informed choice is based on which pizza has the most pepperoni on it. I had no idea food companies were putting traffic lights on their food packaging! </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, and that's not all, Neil. There are now plans to put an <strong>icon</strong></span><span> \u2013 or simple picture \u2013 of someone running plus the time it would take to burn off the calories contained in a particular food item on the front of packaging. Let's hear what some consumers on the streets of London thought about this idea.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>INSERT<br/>People in\u00a0London</span></strong><strong><span><br/></span><span> </span></strong><span>MAN: I would think twice about buying crisps if I have to run 19 minutes just to burn the calories I ate.<br/></span><span>WOMAN: I'd either consider working out those 19 minutes or not eating the crisps at all.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Two people who would think twice about whether to buy crisps if they knew how long it would take to burn off the calories.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And <strong>think twice</strong></span><span> means to think carefully about doing something before you do it. But, to be honest, I want freedom to do what I feel like. Even if they put a label on the food I think </span><span>I'd exercise if I wanted to exercise, but I think I'd still have a packet of crisps if I wanted a packet of crisps.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>That's fine so long as you are clear about how active you need to be to eat what you do and not put on weight. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>But a healthy diet isn't just about calories is it? I wouldn't need to cycle to work to burn off a diet cola, but drinking a fresh orange juice would be a healthier choice \u2013 even though it contains more calories.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Well, that's a good point. Let's listen now to Shirley Cramer, Chief Executive at the Royal Society for Public Health, talking about why she thinks the new labelling is necessary.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>INSERT<br/></span><span> Shirley Cramer, Chief Executive, Royal Society for Public Health<br/></span></strong><span>We've got 60% of the UK population either overweight or obese. We have a very, very urgent problem. We have a growing population, literally, and we need to have a lot of tools in our toolbox, a lot of new strategies, I think, in order to support people to make good choices. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Shirley Cramer of the Royal Society of Public Health. So, she says we need lots of <strong>tools </strong></span><span>\u2013 or strategies \u2013</span><span>to help tackle obesity in the UK. And linking energy content in food to physical activity is just one tool in the toolbox, so to speak.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Indeed. Now, I think it's time for the answer to today's quiz question, Neil. I asked you: How long would you have to walk to burn off the calories in a quarter of a large pizza? Is it\u2026 a) 33 minutes? b) 53 minutes? Or c) 83 minutes?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And I said a) 33 minutes.<br/><br/></span><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>And you underestimated, I'm afraid, Neil! The answer is c) 83 minutes. This figures comes from Shirley Cramer, Chief Executive of the Royal Society for Public Health. Writing in the British Medical Journal, she argues that food should be labelled with the equivalent exercise needed to burn off its calories. This would give consumers an immediate link between food's energy content and physical activity that might help to reduce obesity.<br/><br/></span><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Note, Alice, that I've put my muffin to one side.

I'm Alice\u2026</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>And I'm Neil. Have you ever written any poetry, Alice?</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>No. Have you?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Oh yes. I've got a sheaf of poems from my youth.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>A <strong>sheaf</strong> of something means a bundle of things, particularly paper. What about now? Are you still writing?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>No, my creative juices have dried up.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>What a shame! I would have liked to hear some of your poems! <strong>Creative juices</strong> means a flow of ideas and the subject of today's show is creativity and <strong>writer's block</strong> \u2013 which means not being able to write because of a psychological problem.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So not like tennis elbow or golfer's knee, then.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>No, Neil, because a psychological problem refers to the mind not the body. And whilst some people view writer's block as nonsense others believe it is a serious psychological condition that can get better with treatment.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, I have a question for you, Alice. How does author of the Da Vinci Code, Dan Brown, deal with writer's block? Does he\u2026<br/>a) hang upside down from the ceiling in gravity boots?<br/>b) clean his 6-bedroom house from top to bottom with a toothbrush?<br/>Or c) run a half-marathon listening to opera music by Richard Wagner?</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>I think it's c) run a half-marathon listening to Wagner. Exercise and music might get your creative juices flowing again.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, we'll find out whether you got the right answer later on in the show. <span>But first, Alice, can you tell us where the term writer's block comes from?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Well, the term was <strong>coined</strong></span><span> \u2013 or invented \u2013 in 1950 by a Viennese psychoanalyst Edmund Bergler. Let's</span> listen to <span>Zachary Leader, Professor of English Literature at Roehampton University talking about the psychoanalytic theory of writer's block.</span></p>, <p><strong>INSERT<br/> </strong><strong><span>Zachary Leader, Professor of English Literature at Roehampton University<br/></span></strong><span>Before writers were blocked the other metaphors that were used were things like 'drying up' \u2026 or 'being frozen' or 'stuck in a rut' and so forth. And the difference between being blocked and drying up is that in the case of blockage the problem is externalised and objectified \u2013 it's not yourself that's the problem \u2013 it's something that's outside you like an obstacle or an impediment \u2013 something that you could really cut away, and as a consequence a cure like a growth or a foreign body.</span></p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So writer's block is a metaphor for an obstacle \u2013 something external rather than internal inside of you \u2013 that's preventing you from working. Doesn't that sound like an excuse for not doing anything, Alice? 'It's not my fault \u2013 this impediment thing is getting in the way'.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Yes. Well, <strong>impediment</strong> is another word for obstacle. But how do you cut away a foreign body that isn't actually there?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I suppose psychoanalysts have an answer for that. But seriously, I think writers probably do have a hard time. You can sit down at your desk every morning at 9 o'clock to write but that doesn't mean you're going to think of things to say. Though we're never stuck for words, are we?</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Not usually, Neil, no. But did you know that the Ancient Greeks had <strong>Muses</strong> \u2013 or goddesses of creativity \u2013 to help them?<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So\u2026 Beyonc\u00e9 isn't a real muse? I've heard people say, you know, 'Beyonc\u00e9 is my muse; she's such a great singer, songwriter, dancer, role model!'</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong><span>Well, these days, 'muse' can refer to anyone who inspires an artist, writer, or musician</span>. But in Ancient Greece, there<span> were nine Muses \u2013 and depending on what type of creative thing you did \u2013 philosophy, poetry, science and so on \u2013 you <strong>invoked</strong></span><span> \u2013 or called upon \u2013 that particular Muse to inspire you.<br/><br/></span><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>I call upon you, oh Alice, to enlighten us with more information about the Greek Muses.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Alright then. So let's listen to Angie Hobbs instead. She's Professor of the Public Understanding of Philosophy, University of Sheffield here in the UK \u2013 and here she is now, talking about what the Greek Muses symbolized.</span></p>, <p><strong>INSERT<br/> </strong><strong><span>Angie Hobbs, Professor of the Public Understanding of Philosophy, University of Sheffield<br/></span></strong><span>We've seen that the Muses were connected to running water, to springs, to fountains, fluidity. So if you're musing, you are letting your mind wander, you're opening yourself up to new influences and new ideas, and not thinking in too structured a way. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Musing, letting your mind wander, thinking in a fluid, unstructured way \u2013 that all sounds very pleasant \u2013 maybe I should have another go at writing. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Well, according to research, some people are better at mind wandering and opening themselves up to new ideas than others. Their minds work differently \u2013 they have more dopamine in the thalamus region of the brain. </span></p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong><span>The <strong>thalamus</strong></span><span> controls consciousness, sleep and the senses and </span><strong>dopamine</strong> is the feel-good chemical in the brain<span>. Is that right?</span></p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Yes, and having more dopamine in the thalamus enables some people to see the world in a different way \u2013 and they express this creatively \u2013 through science, music, the arts. Now, before you start musing on how much dopamine you have in your brain, Neil, perhaps you can tell us the answer to today's quiz question?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I asked: How does author of the <em>Da Vinci Code</em>, Dan Brown, deal with writer's block? Does he\u2026<br/>a) hang upside down from the ceiling in gravity boots?<br/>b) clean his 6-bedroom house from top to bottom with a toothbrush?<br/>Or c) run a half-marathon listening to opera music by Richard Wagner?</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>And I said c) run a half-marathon listening to opera music by Richard Wagner.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And you were wrong, Alice! The answer is a) hang upside down from the ceiling in gravity boots.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Really?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes. I expect all that increased blood flow to the brain is helpful in clearing writer's block.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Yes. Good plan. OK, here are the words we learned today.<br/>creative juices<br/>writer's block<br/>coined<br/>impediment<br/>Muses<br/>invoked<br/>thalamus<br/>dopamine<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So, Alice, shall I compare thee to a summer's day?

So Alice, can you think of an example of how the English we speak is changing?</span></p>, <p><span> </span><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, I can \u2013 teenagers saying 'like' all the time\u2026</span></p>, <p><span> </span><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Oh, that's, like, really like annoying, like? </span></p>, <p><span> </span><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Well, the subject of today's show is how and why the English language is changing. And teenagers definitely have their own code \u2013 including text speak when they're on the internet or using their phones. Fomo, bae, plos \u2013 do you have any idea what those terms mean, Neil? </span></p>, <p><span> </span><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>I've got no idea what you're talking about, Alice. They're pretty <strong>baffling</strong></span><span> \u2013 and that means 'hard to understand'. But that's the idea, isn't it? We oldies aren't supposed to understand!</span></p>, <p><span> </span><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, exactly! Apparently, 'plos' means 'parents looking over shoulder' \u2013 which proves your point! Text speak is a lot to do with inventing cool new terms \u2013 and these change quickly. In a year, or even six months time, words that were once popular, have disappeared completely.</span></p>, <p><span> </span><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>OK, I have a quiz question forming in my mind, Alice \u2013 so I hope you're feeling up to the challenge, Alice. Can you tell me, what kinds of words are slow to change? Is it...<br/></span><span>a) nouns?<br/></span><span>b) pronouns?<br/></span><span>Or c) adjectives?</span></p>, <p><span> </span><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>I think it's a) nouns. The way we name things probably doesn't change that quickly. </span></p>, <p><span> </span><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>We shall find out if you are right or wrong later on in the show. But let's think about English grammar for a minute, and what changes are occurring here. </span></p>, <p><span> </span><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>I noticed you said 'shall' there, Neil. And to my ear, that sounds pretty old fashioned.</span></p>, <p><span> </span><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And you're very right, Alice. The modal verb 'shall' is <strong>on the way out</strong></span><span> \u2013 meaning it's disappearing. Why do you think that is?</span></p>, <p><span> </span><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Well, perhaps it's because 'will' sounds more natural these days. Let's listen to linguist Bas Aarts, talking to writer and presenter, Michael Rosen on the BBC Radio 4 programme <em>Word of Mouth</em></span><span>, </span><span>for his explanation.</span></p>, <p><span> </span><strong><span>INSERT<br/></span><span> </span></strong><strong><span>Presenter Michael Rosen and Bas Aarts, Professor of English linguistics at University College London<br/></span></strong><span>MR: Why would we lose 'shall'? I mean, if especially as we hold it in the interrogative. We say, you know, 'Shall we go swimming'?<br/></span><span>BA: Well, because it's in competition with 'will'. If you have two words that more or less express the same meaning, one of the two is going to be pushed out of the language. And in this case, it's 'shall'.</span></p>, <p><span> </span><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Bas Aarts there. And <strong>interrogative</strong></span><span> means 'a question'. So it's not just in nature that we get survival of the fittest \u2013 you know, the struggle for life \u2013 it happens in language too. Similar words are competing with each other, and some lose while others </span><strong><span>win out</span></strong><span> \u2013 or succeed after a fight. Do you know of any other modal verbs that are on their way out, Alice?</span></p>, <p><span> </span><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Yes \u2013 'must' is declining rapidly.\u00a0 </span></p>, <p><span> </span><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Why's that?</span></p>, <p><span> </span><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>'Must' sounds authoritarian, and people are choosing to express <strong>obligation</strong></span><span> \u2013 or having a duty to do something \u2013 in different ways.</span></p>, <p><span> </span><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>OK, <strong>authoritarian</strong></span><span> means 'demanding that people obey you'. For example: Alice, you must move on to the next point, now!</span></p>, <p><span> </span><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Oh, you scared me a bit there, Neil!</span></p>, <p><span> </span><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Exactly. I can see why people are <strong>shying away from</strong></span><span> \u2013 or avoiding \u2013 'must'. It sounds nicer to soften obligation by saying things like, 'You </span><em><span>might</span></em><span> want to move on to the next point now, Alice.'</span></p>, <p><span> </span><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>OK, then, I shall. Let's talk about tenses. <strong>Progressive</strong></span><span> tenses \u2013 formed from the verb </span><em><span>be</span></em><span> and the suffix \u2013</span><em><span>ing</span></em><span> \u2013 are usually used for ongoing situations, for example, 'I'm doing the show with Neil at the moment'. But its use has been increasing rapidly. Let's listen to Michael Rosen and Bas Aarts again talking about this.</span></p>, <p><span> </span><strong><span>INSERT<br/></span><span> </span></strong><strong><span>Presenter Michael Rosen and Bas Aarts, Professor of English linguistics at University College London <br/></span></strong><span>BA: It started increasing dramatically in the 19th </span><span>century and has continued to rise in the present day.<br/></span><span>MR: I think that's a cue for me to say, 'I'm loving it', is that right?<br/></span><span>BA: Well, that is one of the constructions that is coming in, I mean, I sometimes call it the Big Mac progressive because of course McDonald's use that.</span></p>, <p><span data-mce-mark=\"1\"> </span><strong><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">Neil<br/></span></strong><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">In this segment of the BBC Radio 4 programme <em>Word of Mouth</em></span><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">, Michael Rosen quotes the progressive form 'I'm loving it' \u2013 a slogan used by an American fast-food chain in its advertising campaign.</span></p>, <p><span> </span><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>The verb 'love' is a <strong>stative</strong></span><span> verb. It expresses a state of being \u2013 as opposed to doing \u2013 and is traditionally used in the simple form, for example, 'I love it'. </span><span>But these days, people are using stative verbs in the progressive more and more.</span></p>, <p><span> </span><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>I'm hearing what you're saying, Alice! Now, I think it's time for the answer to today's quiz question. I asked you: What kinds of words are slow to change? Is it\u2026 a) nouns, b) pronouns or c) adjectives?</span></p>, <p><span> </span><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>I said a) nouns.</span></p>, <p><span> </span><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And you were wrong, Alice! According to Professor Mark Pagel, evolutionary biologist at Reading University in the UK, pronouns like 'I' and 'you' and 'we' evolve slowly \u2013 a thousand years ago we would be using similar or sometimes identical sounds. Similarly, number words evolve very slowly \u2013 our ancestors were using related sounds a thousand or perhaps even two thousand years ago. Whereas nouns and adjectives get replaced quite rapidly \u2013 and in five hundred years or so we'll probably be using different words to the ones we use now.</span></p>, <p><span> </span><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Well, I got that completely wrong then!

I'm Alice\u2026<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>And I'm Neil.<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>So, Neil, what's the best holiday you've ever had?<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>That would be scuba diving on the Great Barrier Reef off the coast of Australia. It was awesome! I saw sharks, sea turtles, manta rays... <br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>I certainly don't like the idea of coming nose to nose with a shark! But then diving isn't really my thing. I'm more into cultural holidays \u2013 you know, visiting the ruins of ancient civilisations.<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>That's very worthy, Alice. But tourists are actually damaging a number of important sites around the world \u2013 tramping around, dropping litter, scribbling graffiti everywhere\u2026<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>I would never drop litter or scribble graffiti!<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, we're talking about world heritage sites today, which are places UNESCO considers to be at risk from various threats and in need of protection. <strong>Heritage</strong> means the things a society considers important to its history and culture, for example art, buildings, or natural sites such as the Grand Canyon in the United States.<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>And the environment poses a number of different threats. So, Neil, can you tell me which sea creature is a potential threat to the Great Barrier Reef's ecosystem? Is it a \u2026 <br/>a) starfish?<br/>b) jellyfish?<br/>Or c) cuttlefish?<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I will go for b) jellyfish. I'm no expert on marine life, but I have eaten jellyfish and I haven't eaten the other ones.<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Oh, I see. Well, we'll find out later on if you are an expert or not. But let's listen now to BBC reporter Roger Harrabin talking about other types of threat to heritage sites. See how many you can spot!<br/><br/><strong>INSERT<br/> Roger Harrabin, BBC reporter<br/></strong>The most precious wonders of the natural world \u2013 Australia's Great Barrier Reef, America's spectacular Grand Canyon, the Barrier Reef of Belize in South America, second biggest on Earth \u2013 all facing threats from humans. The Great Barrier Reef is attracting urgent concern. There's a huge battle over mining and port development. A giant coalmine has just been given the go-ahead by the Queensland government even though scientists warn it may damage the Reef.<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>That's the BBC's Roger Harrabin. Well, I spotted a couple of threats to heritage sites there \u2013 mining and port development. Now, any type of industrial activity can harm them by, for example, encroaching on the natural habitat of animals and plants living there, or by polluting the water that flows into the site.<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong><strong>Mining</strong> is the process of extracting coal or other minerals from the ground, and if you <strong>encroach on something</strong>, it means you move beyond acceptable limits. The interesting thing is that world heritage sites only constitute 0.5% of the Earth's surface \u2013 so why can't people do their mining and industrial development on the remaining 99.5%!<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>But there is one human industry that can actually be beneficial for precious sites: tourism.<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>But you said earlier that tourism was bad for heritage sites.<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I know. And I was right, up to a point. World heritage sites are some of tourism's main attractions, and more and more people are visiting them. So it's all about getting the balance right between generating money to maintain and restore the sites and minimizing the impact of tourist activities.<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Such as littering and graffiti.<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Exactly. And the term for this is <strong>sustainable</strong> <strong>tourism</strong> \u2013 or tourism designed to have a low impact on the local culture and the environment, while generating employment for local people.<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>So UNESCO is working to direct governments, site managers and visitors towards sustainable tourism practices in order to keep our world's natural and cultural heritage safe for future generations.<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Wow, you can really talk the talk, Alice. You should work for UNESCO! OK, let's move on now, and listen to Paul Crocombe, of the Snorkelling and Diving Company in Townsville, Queensland, Australia, giving his view on how the Great Barrier Reef will cope with threats to its survival.<br/><br/><strong>INSERT<br/> Paul Crocombe, Snorkelling and diving company, Townsville, Queensland, Australia<br/></strong>The Reef's fairly dynamic, it's been through a couple of ice ages, and is still here, so its resilience will ensure that the Reef is still here in years to come. But the species diversity and the\u2026 the visual aesthetics of the Reef may change quite considerably, especially if we get an increase in sea temperature, an increase in carbon dioxide in the water, and things like that.<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Paul Crocombe describes the Reef as 'dynamic' and 'resilient'.<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong><strong>Dynamic</strong> means active or capable of changing and <strong>resilience</strong> means the ability to recover or adapt to change \u2013 which all sounds good. But Paul also says that the <strong>species diversity</strong> \u2013 the range of plants and animals \u2013 may change.<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>For example, a rise in sea temperature would cause a rise in carbon dioxide levels \u2013 and this could have a big impact on both the species diversity and the Reef's <strong>visual aesthetic</strong> \u2013 or the way it looks.<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>OK, I think it's time now for the answer to today's quiz question, Alice.<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Yes, I think so too. OK, so, I asked you: Which sea creature poses a potential threat to the Great Barrier Reef's ecosystem? Is it a type of \u2026\u00a0 a) starfish, b) jellyfish or c) cuttlefish?<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I said b) jellyfish.<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>And you got stung, I'm afraid, Neil!<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Ouch!<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>The answer is starfish. The crown-of-thorns starfish preys on coral and large outbreaks of these starfish can devastate reefs. Now, can you remind us of some of today's vocabulary, Neil?<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Sure:<br/>heritage<br/>encroach on something<br/>sustainable tourism<br/>dynamic<br/>resilience<br/>species diversity<br/>visual aesthetic<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

I'm Alice\u2026<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>And I'm Neil. Did you have a good weekend, Alice?<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Yes, but it <strong>flew by</strong> \u2013 which means it went quickly \u2013 and here we are again, back at work!<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Hm. I know what you mean. Though I must say, time really <strong>dragged</strong> for me \u2013 and that means it went slowly. I was on a train, which broke down.<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Oh dear!</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And it felt like it took forever to arrive \u2013 though actually it was only delayed only by one hour.<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well, today we're talking about our <strong>perception</strong> of \u2013 or the way we see \u2013 time. It's true that when we're busy doing lots of things, time flies by.<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And when we're bored or have nothing to do, it drags. And I didn't have anything to do on the train. Do you think time flows at the same rate for everyone \u2013 even animals? My cat doesn't get bored doing nothing all day. I wonder if time drags for her sometimes?<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Good question! Did you know, Neil, that, according to a new study, smaller animals perceive time as if it is passing in slow motion?<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>That sounds weird. Do you think they hear us like this: t\u2026a\u2026l\u2026k\u2026i\u2026n\u2026g\u00a0\u00a0 s\u2026l\u2026o\u2026w\u2026l\u2026y\u2026?<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Don't be silly, Neil! What I meant was that small animals such as insects and small birds can observe more detail in a certain period of time \u2013 for example, a second \u2013 than larger animals.<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And how does this help them, exactly? It sounds like the day would really drag if every second got stretched out like that!<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>It helps them by giving them time to escape larger predators. Now, I have a question for you, Neil. Can you tell me roughly how much more quickly a fly's eye can react than a human eye? Is it \u2026<br/>a) twice as quickly?<br/>b) four times as quickly?<br/>Or c) ten times as quickly?<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, I'll go for c) ten times. Flies are pretty <strong>nippy</strong> \u2013 and that's another word for quick.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Yes. Well, we'll find out later on if you got the answer right or not. Now, small animals can typically process more visual information than we can. But in a dangerous situation our brains can work in overdrive to process information more quickly. And <strong>overdrive</strong> means a state of extreme activity. Let's listen to Raza Rumi, a writer and broadcaster in Pakistan, talking about the unusual way his brain worked when gunmen opened fire on him in his car.<br/><br/><strong>INSERT<br/> </strong><strong>Raza Rumi, writer and broadcaster, Pakistan<br/></strong>It lasted for a few minutes \u2013 but to me that particular incident feels like it was for hours. I think my brain was working in a very strange way. Parallel and multiple thoughts and streams of consciousness were sort of running along: 'I have to save my head because if I get a bullet in my brain I'm dead.' And at the same time, 'Was it all worth it?' And, 'Alas, what a short life it was, it was lovely.' I was petrified that I was going to die.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Raza Rumi there. So, he was <strong>petrified</strong> by the attack \u2013 which means extremely frightened. As a result, his brain started working in a strange way. He was thinking and feeling lots of different things at the same time.<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>That's right \u2013 he remembers thinking practical thoughts like, 'I have to save my head'.<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>But <strong>in parallel</strong> \u2013 or at the same time \u2013 he also remembers having philosophical thoughts, such as: What a short life it was, it was lovely.<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Have you ever been in a dangerous situation where your brain went into overdrive, Neil?<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, I was ten years old and I fell backwards out of a big tree in our garden.<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Oh no!<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yeah. I have a vivid memory of the sun flashing above me, and the clouds moving across the sky, and the leaves rustling in the tree above me \u2013 my mum was screaming through the kitchen window as she saw me fall. I experienced so much in the space of just a few seconds, just like Raza Rumi describes.<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Yes. A <strong>vivid</strong> memory, by the way, is clear and detailed. Oh, poor Neil! Did you hurt yourself?<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Some big bruises \u2013 but no broken bones.<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Glad to hear it. Now, it's a strange trick of memory that in a scary situation your brain starts to record everything in great detail. And the more memory you have of an event, the longer you believe it took. This idea explains why children often feel that time is passing slowly \u2013 because their experiences are new, and they are creating lots of new memories.<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Whereas boring grown-ups like us are following routines that don't require new memories because they're so familiar. But let's listen to Claudia Hammond, author of <em>Time Warp</em>ed, talking about how we can stretch time and make our days feel longer \u2013 in a good way!<br/><br/><strong>INSERT<br/> </strong><strong><span>Claudia Hammond, author of <em>Time Warped<br/></em></span></strong><span>If you can spend your weekend filling it with loads of new different activities, it'll go fast, at the time, because you're having fun. But when you look back, say, on Sunday night, and you've got to go to work next day, it will feel as if your weekend was long, because you filled it with new memories.<br/><br/></span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>We should do that, this weekend, Neil. What do you think?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Definitely. I'm going to buzz around like a fly, creating loads of new memories.<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Now, are you ready for the answer to today's quiz question? I asked: Roughly how much more quickly a fly's eye can react than a human eye? Is it \u2026 a) twice as quickly, b) four times as quickly or c) ten times as quickly?<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I said c) ten times as quickly.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>The correct answer is b) four times as quickly. Flies have eyes that send updates to the brain at much higher frequencies than our eyes because they can process the information more quickly. This speed illustrates the impressive capabilities of even the smallest animal brains.<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, before we buzz off, perhaps we should hear the words we learned today.

I didn't build enough houses, which created a lot of homeless Sims \u2013 those are the characters in the game. And then I didn't deal effectively with a flood\u2026<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Really? Well, I suppose managing a city is quite a challenge \u2013 which is the subject of today's show: cities of the future \u2013 an important subject as so many of us now live in urban areas. I want to start with our quiz question: What is the percentage of the world's population that will be living in cities in 2050? We're dealing with approximates here. Is it\u2026<br/>a) 10%?<br/>b) 50%?<br/>Or c) 70%?<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I think that it's a) 10%.<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well, we'll find out if you're right or wrong later on in the show. Now, you've encountered a couple of issues that might face urban planners when designing a city, Neil \u2013 housing and dealing with a flood. Can you think of any others?<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes. Having decent cycle lanes. Good transport networks are very important.<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Yes indeed, and if people could get around easily on foot, or by bike, or by public transport, roads would be less <strong>congested</strong> \u2013 or overcrowded \u2013 and less polluted. That sounds rather utopian to me though.<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>A <strong>utopia</strong> is an imaginary place where everything is perfect. But Copenhagen is pretty utopian, Alice - t<span>he air is clean, there are bike lanes everywhere.<br/><br/></span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>That sounds fantastic, but what about somewhere like Beijing with its constant <strong>smog</strong> \u2013 or air pollution \u2013 hanging over the city? A lot of people ride bikes there too. So which city is going to be the model for the future?<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Maybe like the future Los Angeles in the movie <em>Blade Runner</em> \u2013 you know, glittering high-rises, gigantic neon billboards, flying cars\u2026<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well, today's Los Angeles has terrible urban sprawl and traffic problems.<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong><strong>Urban sprawl</strong> is the way a city spreads into undeveloped land around it, often without planning permission.<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Dr Janice Pearlman can explain why this happens. She is the founder and president of the Megacities Project non-profit organization in Rio de Janeiro and knows a lot about urban sprawl in Brazilian cities.<br/><br/><strong>INSERT<br/> </strong><strong><span>Dr Janice Pearlman, founder and president of the Megacities Project non-profit organization, Rio de Janeiro<br/></span></strong><span>People are coming massively into the cities which have no housing that's affordable to them. So they can't rent and they can't buy, and they end up building their own communities and houses on unoccupied land. And these communities are becoming in some places the majority not the minority and they're off the grid so they're not often serviced by either the social services but also many of them don't have water, sanitation and electricity.<br/><br/></span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>People <strong>migrate</strong> \u2013 or move \u2013 from the countryside to the city to get better opportunities, but end up with nowhere to live.<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>So they build their own housing on unoccupied land. These <strong>shanty towns</strong> \u2013 poor communities where the houses are built out of cheap materials like corrugated iron and plastic sheeting \u2013 are often <strong>off the grid</strong>\u2026<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Which means they don't have an electricity or water supply \u2013 or access to healthcare and education. And these communities are growing, so the problem is getting bigger. So are there any solutions, Alice?<br/><br/><strong>Alice</strong></p>, <p>Well, it's all about improving the <strong>infrastructure</strong>. That's the basic facilities a town or city needs, for example: communication, transport, water, and electricity. But this shouldn't only mean improving housing conditions, but also promoting education and employment among the inhabitants, and building better communities.<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>That sounds like a real headache for the urban planners.<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>You're right there. And one thing urban planners are talking about at the moment is creating 'smart cities'. John Rossant, founder and chairman of the non-profit organisation New Cities Foundation, explains what it is.<br/><br/><strong>INSERT<br/> </strong><strong><span>John Rossant, founder and chairman of the non-profit organisation New Cities Foundation, New York City<br/></span></strong><span>I think, you know, generally it's accepted that cloud computing, ubiquitous internet, robust 5G networks etc, will transform our cities, whether they're in the global south or the developed world. And, you know, technology is really a game changer, I think, in urbanisation.<br/><br/></span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>John Rossant there. What's <strong>ubiquitous</strong>, Alice?<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>It means available everywhere. So, the idea behind smart cities is to use technology to collect large amounts of data about how a city is performing.<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And that will be a <strong>game changer</strong> \u2013 significantly affecting the way our cities function.Hope for the future, Alice?<strong><br/><br/></strong><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Fingers crossed. Now, I think it's time for the answer to today's quiz question, Neil. I asked: What is the percentage of the world's population that will be living in cities in 2050? And remember I said we are dealing with approximates here? Is it\u2026\u00a0 a) 10%? b) 50%?

I'm Alice\u2026</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>\u2026 And I'm Neil. Can you pass me my drink, Alice?</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Cola, Neil? That's very unhealthy.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>You told me to stop drinking coffee because it's unhealthy \u2013 now you're telling me cola is bad too.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Cola is full of sugar. There are about six teaspoons in each can.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>At least. That's pretty sugary, I admit!</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well, we're talking about diabetes today. <strong>Diabetes</strong> is a condition where the body can't control the amount of <strong>glucose</strong> \u2013 or sugar \u2013 in the blood. If left untreated, diabetes can cause many complications, including heart attack, stroke, kidney failure, and blindness.<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I'm not diabetic, though, Alice, so what's the problem?</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well, diabetes is <strong>on the rise</strong> \u2013 or increasing \u2013 all over the world. And particularly type 2 diabetes where risk factors include <strong>obesity</strong> \u2013 or being very overweight \u2013 unhealthy diet and lack of physical exercise.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I see. Well, while I think about that, maybe you could ask me today's quiz question.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>OK. Can you tell me how many people in the world suffer from diabetes? Is it\u2026<br/>a) 4.15 million?<br/>b) 41.5 million?<br/>Or c) 415 million?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I'll take a guess and say b) 41.5 million.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well, we'll find out if you got the right answer later on, Neil. Now, why do you think people are eating less healthily than they used to?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, processed food has become very popular, and whilst it often tastes really good, it isn't always a healthy choice.\u00a0\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Do you eat a lot of processed food, Neil?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Of course not, Alice! <strong>Processed</strong> <strong>food</strong>, by the way, is food that's been changed from its natural state, for example, by freezing or re-hydrating it, or by adding ingredients to it such as sugar, salt or fat. But let's move on now and talk about exercise.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>OK \u2013 but I hope you aren't planning to have fried chicken again for lunch today from that dodgy fast-food joint round the corner. Now, one reason that people are taking less exercise than they used to is because of lifestyle changes. With increasing urbanisation people are no longer doing jobs that involve as much physical activity.\u00a0\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, it's true. And <strong>urbanisation</strong> means the growth of towns and cities as people move there from the countryside to live and work. We're all sitting in cars, and offices, or on our sofas in front of the TV.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>But it's also true that children are less active than they used to be. I remember running around all the time outdoors when I was a kid. Nowadays, they're all in front of screens, playing computer games or watching videos on YouTube.\u00a0\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>So, adults and children are at higher risk of developing diabetes if they are overweight because they are likely to have higher levels of sugar in their blood. Let's hear more about this from Dr Etienne Krug from the World Health Organization.</p>, <p><strong>INSERT<br/> </strong><strong>Dr Etienne Krug, Director of the World Health Organization<br/></strong>Diabetes is a kind of continuum. Gradually the levels of sugar in the blood increase until reaching the level of being diagnosed with diabetes. But people, before reaching diabetes, have too high level of sugar as well, sometimes, and that can be dangerous too \u2013 particularly causing cardiovascular diseases, which contributes to mortality too.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>What's a <strong>continuum</strong>, Alice?</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>It's something that changes slowly over time. So in this case, as people increasingly eat food that's high in sugar and fat, the amount of sugar in their blood increases.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And having a high blood-sugar level may reach a <strong>tipping point </strong>\u2013 or a point when small changes become significant enough to cause a big change \u2013 and you develop diabetes. But even if you don't develop diabetes, high blood sugar can be damaging to your health.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>It isn't only damaging to the individual, though. Diabetes has a huge cost to society \u2013 $827bn is currently being spent every year to treat the disease.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>That's big bucks! What can we do \u2013 what can governments do \u2013 to tackle this health crisis, Alice?</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well, a key approach is to tackle the global rise in obesity because this addresses not only diabetes but other diseases, too, such as cancer and cardiovascular disease. Let's hear more from Dr Krug about ways to do this.</p>, <p><strong>INSERT<br/> </strong><strong>Dr Etienne Krug, Director of the World Health Organization<br/></strong>We need a combination of approaches to promote physical activity and to improve the ways we eat and that goes from breast feeding or even working with young kids to increase healthy eating. But the sugar tax is a good example that has contributed in Mexico to a decrease in sales of sugary drinks. And sugary drinks \u2013 just one drink can sometimes represent more sugar than a person needs for the whole day.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Government schemes to encourage healthy eating sound like a good plan, but trying to get kids to eat vegetables might be tough!</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Or stop you from drinking sugary drinks, Neil, for that matter.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Leave me alone!</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Alright, then. But the government tax on sugary drinks has worked in Mexico \u2013 and the UK government is also planning to do this. OK \u2013 now remember I asked you, Neil: How many people in the world suffer from diabetes? Is it\u2026 a) 4.15 million? b) 41.5 million? Or c) 415 million?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I said 41.5 million.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Sorry, that's the wrong answer, Neil.<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Of course it's the wrong answer!<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Yes, I'm afraid so. According to the Diabetes International Federation, based in Belgium, as of 2015, an estimated 415 million people have diabetes worldwide. This represents 8.3% of the adult population, with equal rates in both women and men.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>OK, I'll be drinking herbal tea from now on. Let's listen to the words we learned today. They were:<br/>diabetes<br/>glucose<br/>on the rise<br/>obesity<br/>processed food<br/>urbanisation<br/>continuum<br/>tipping point</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

If I'd known you weren't going to do the research, I'd have done it myself. What did you actually do at the weekend, anyway?</p>, <p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>Oh, you know, this and that. It's funny how time slips by without you noticing.</p>, <p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>Hmm, yes.

That's unfair and untrue, Alice \u2013 well, mostly untrue, anyway \u2013 I did some shopping and I fixed my bike as well as watching videos and googling myself.</p>, <p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>Well, perhaps I should say at this point that today's show is about <strong>procrastination</strong>, which means not doing something you're supposed to do.</p>, <p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>Well, I do feel bad about my procrastination actually.</p>, <p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>Well, that's good to hear. But let's move on now and hear today's quiz question: Can you tell me which American said: 'You may delay, but time will not?' Was it\u2026</p>, <p>a) John F Kennedy?<br/>b) Benjamin Franklin?<br/>Or c) Franklin\u00a0Roosevelt?</p>, <p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>OK. I think I'll go for a) John F Kennedy because I reckon he was good at making to-do lists and then getting on with them.</p>, <p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>Unlike somebody I could mention.</p>, <p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>Alice, I thought we were going to move on?</p>, <p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>Alright then.</p>, <p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>Personally, I think it's important to try and understand why we procrastinate. So let's hear from Daphna Oyserman, Professor of Psychology, Communication and Education at the University of Southern California, talking about this.</p>, <p><strong>INSERT</strong><br/><strong>Daphna Oyserman, Professor of Psychology, Communication and Education at the University of Southern California</strong><br/>People spend most of their time focussed on the present, which makes perfect sense because the present is now, and for sure. Unfortunately, many things that are quite important about the future require that we start doing things now rather than waiting for later to happen. Things like saving for retirement, studying for college entry exams, revising papers, preparing for work reports. Unfortunately, waiting till later means that we won't have much time.</p>, <p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>So, we are too focussed on the present, and reluctant to engage in tasks that relate to the future. Why's that, Rob?</p>, <p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>Well, like Professor Oyserman says, things in the future may never happen \u2013 or seem too far off for you to take seriously. For example, when you're young, sorting out a pension plan doesn't feel like a <strong>priority</strong> \u2013 or something that's more important than other things.</p>, <p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>But according to a new study, if you think about time in smaller units \u2013 so days, for example, rather than months or years \u2013 you are likely to start a task more quickly.</p>, <p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>So, this weekend I wasted two days\u2026</p>, <p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>Or 2,880 minutes.</p>, <p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>That does sound more urgent, when you put it like that.</p>, <p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>Yes. And you need to <strong>minimize</strong> \u2013 or reduce \u2013 distractions. Turn off your tech and knuckle down to your tasks, Rob.</p>, <p><strong>Rob</strong><br/><strong>To knuckle down</strong>, by the way, means to start working hard. But Alice, sometimes it's hard to knuckle down to a task when you don't know how to start it \u2013 or you're scared to start it \u2013 or sometimes just because you know it's going to be really<strong> tedious</strong> \u2013 and that means boring.</p>, <p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>Yes. So what's your excuse, Rob?</p>, <p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>Well, it's boredom, usually.</p>, <p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>You should try temptation bundling.</p>, <p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>Temptation bundling - what's that?</p>, <p><strong>Alice</strong><br/><strong>Temptation bundling</strong> means doing two activities together \u2013 one you should do but are avoiding, and one you love doing which isn't productive.</p>, <p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>For example, eating biscuits while I work?</p>, <p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>Yes, that's right. That sounds like a good one for you, Rob.</p>, <p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>It might be a good idea actually. Well, let's listen to Dr Catherine Loveday talking about how we often underestimate how long things will take us.</p>, <p><strong>INSERT</strong><br/><strong>Dr Catherine Loveday, Westminster University<br/></strong>There's this thing called the planning fallacy. My favourite one is always the example of the Oxford English Dictionary that they started in 1857 and it was supposed to take five years, but five years later they'd only got to the word 'ant'. In the end it took another 70 years and then it was out of date and they had to start again anyway. We never seem to get any better at judging time in the future and how long things will take us.</p>, <p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>That's Dr Catherine Loveday. So what's a <strong>fallacy</strong>, Alice?</p>, <p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>It's a mistaken belief or idea.</p>, <p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>And for the famous Oxford English Dictionary \u2013 their mistake was to think they would get the work done in five years when it actually took 70!</p>, <p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>Gosh! Wow! What a long time! And talking about time \u2013 ours is running out\u00a0\u2013\u00a0let's go back to today's question. I asked: Which American said, \"You may delay, but time will not?\" Was it \u2026 a) John F Kennedy, b) Benjamin Franklin or c) Franklin Roosevelt?</p>, <p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>And I very confidently said John F Kennedy.</p>, <p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>Yes, you did. And you were wrong today Rob, I'm afraid. It was Benjamin Franklin, one of the Founding Fathers of the United States. Franklin was a leading author, printer, political theorist, politician, freemason, postmaster, scientist, inventor, civic activist, statesman, and diplomat. I doubt he wasted much waste time procrastinating!</p>, <p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>No. OK, without further delay, here are the words we learned today:<br/>procrastination<br/>priority<br/>minimize<br/>knuckle down<br/>tedious<br/>temptation bundling<br/>fallacy</p>, <p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

I'm Alice\u2026</p>, <p><span> </span><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>\u2026 And I'm Neil.</p>, <p><span> </span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Can you do any impersonations, Neil?</p>, <p><span> </span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>How about this one: My name is Michael Caine. Not a lot of people know that.</p>, <p><span> </span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Michael Caine, one of our best loved actors here in Britain. Not bad, Neil. And is a very good way to start today's show. We are talking about <strong>impersonation</strong> \u2013 or the act of pretending to be somebody else. Why do we like impersonations, Neil?</p>, <p><span> </span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, sometimes the impersonator is a comedian and doing it to be funny. But another reason is that we get the opportunity to meet people who are no longer with us \u2013 like Elvis Presley or Marilyn Monroe. Either way, it helps if it's a good impersonation.</p>, <p><span> </span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Yes, some impersonations are pretty <strong>cheesy</strong> \u2013 and that means bad quality.</p>, <p><span> </span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Oh yeah so\u2026 uh-huh\u2026 OK, Alice, I have a question for you!</p>, <p><span> </span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Neil, that's terrible!</p>, <p><span> </span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Elvis, please, come on. Can you tell me the name of a musical act that impersonates a famous group? Is it \u2026<br/>a) tribute, <br/>b) tribune,<br/>or c) tribunal?</p>, <p><span> </span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>I'll go for a) tribute.</p>, <p><span> </span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>A tribute act? OK, well, we'll find out if you got that right later on in the show. But, Alice, don't you think some impersonators start to believe they really are the personalities they imitate?</p>, <p><span> </span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>What makes you say that?</p>, <p><span> </span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Just think: every time you appear as Elvis Presley, you get fans yelling, 'Elvis, Elvis, we love you, Elvis!' And after a while that boundary between you and the real Elvis starts to blur. It must be quite tempting to, you know, pretend that you're the king of rock'n'roll\u2026</p>, <p><span> </span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>I'm not convinced, Neil. I think Elvis hangs up his wig and moves on. So let's move on too, and talk about the art of imitation. Here's British impressionist Jon Culshaw providing some tips on how to <strong>imitate</strong> \u2013 or copy \u2013 people.</p>, <p><span> </span><strong>INSERT<br/> Jon Culshaw, impressionist<br/></strong>Don't just say the catchphrase, don't just say, 'I am Michael Caine.' Say a bit more, get some gags going, some conversation going. Notice the things which are worth stretching, which are worth exaggerating to really give you the caricature of that person. It might be a little tic, it might be a little nuance - whatever you notice first really.</p>, <p><span> </span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Jon Culshaw, there. What's a <strong>catchphrase</strong>, Neil?</p>, <p><span> </span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>It's a well-known phrase, often associated with a famous person \u2013 like the one I used for Michael Caine earlier on! 'Not a lot of people know that.' So Jon is saying that it isn't enough to repeat a catchphrase or use another impersonator's ideas \u2013 you need to think of your own <strong>gags</strong> \u2013 or jokes.</p>, <p><span> </span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>And you do this by noticing and then exaggerating a person's tics. A <strong>tic</strong> is something you do often without realizing you're doing it, like using certain phrases or gestures \u2013 for example, scratching your head. Or in your case, Neil, wiggling your eyebrows.</p>, <p><span> </span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Do I wiggle my eyebrows?</p>, <p><span> </span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>You're doing it right now! But moving on, there is a serious and very negative side to impersonation. Some <strong>impostors</strong> \u2013 or people who deceive others by pretending to be somebody else \u2013 pose as doctors or lawyers, for example.</p>, <p><span> </span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>You mean without having the qualifications to do the job?</p>, <p><span> </span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Exactly \u2013 which can have serious consequences, for example pretending to be a doctor with no medical knowledge.</p>, <p><span> </span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Like in the film with Leonardo DiCaprio where his character impersonates an airline pilot, a doctor, and a lawyer.</p>, <p><span> </span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>DiCaprio's character in the movie Catch Me If You Can is actually based on a real man called Frank Abagnale. Pan Am estimated that in two years Abagnale flew 250 flights to 26 countries.</p>, <p><span> </span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>OK, let's listen to Dr Naftali G. Berrill, a forensic psychologist in New York City. He evaluates people for the American government. Here he's talking about another real case of a woman in the US who was caught pretending to be an attorney \u2013 that's a lawyer.</p>, <p><span> </span><strong>INSERT<br/> </strong><strong>Dr Naftali G. Berrill, forensic psychologist in New York City<br/></strong>The thing that was most troubling is that because she realized that she was not an attorney and that she was taking people's money under false pretence, there was no sense of remorse or sense of sadness that she had exploited the people that trusted her. But, you know, in cases where you get these impostors who specifically are pursuing financial gain, they know what they're doing, but they do it with the shallow conscience of an antisocial personality.</p>, <p><span> </span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>That was Dr Naftali G. Berrill. What does <strong>remorse</strong> mean, Neil?</p>, <p><span> </span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>It means being sorry for something you've done.</p>, <p><span> </span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>And our <strong>conscience</strong> is our inner sense of right or wrong \u2013 so a <strong>shallow</strong> conscience is one that isn't very deep.</p>, <p><span> </span><strong>Neil<br/></strong><strong>Antisocial</strong> in this context means harmful to other people and to society \u2013 although in a general sense, it means not enjoying the company of others.</p>, <p><span> </span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>OK. Well, I love your company, Neil, as you know. Now, how about the answer to today's quiz question?</p>, <p><span> </span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I asked: What's the name we use for a band that impersonates a famous group? Is it \u2026 a) tribute? b) tribune? Or c) tribunal?</p>, <p><span> </span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>I said tribute.<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And you were right!<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Hurray!<br/><br/><strong>Neil</strong><br/> Many tribute acts copy the singing style and the appearance of the group as well as playing their music. They often name themselves based on the original band's name (sometimes with a pun), or on one of their songs or albums. For example, <em>Bjorn Again</em> \u2013 a famous Abba tribute band. This name is a pun on 'Bjorn', a member of Abba, and the phrase 'Born Again', which means to come back to life!<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>OK. It's time to hear the words we learned today.

I'm Alice\u2026<br/><br/><strong>Rob<br/> </strong>\u2026 And I'm Rob.<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>So, it's nearly exam time again. And the subject of today's show is how to prepare well for an exam.<br/><br/><strong>Rob<br/></strong>I've got some great tips, actually, Alice.</p>, <p><span> </span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Have you really? Can you remind me what grades you got at school?<br/><br/><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes, well \u2026 [mumbles] \u2026<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>So, you didn't get very good grades.</p>, <p><span> </span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>I probably should've started revising earlier. But my learning strategies were very good.<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Oh, really? Well, when you <strong>revise</strong> for an exam you study information you learned before. OK, Rob, I'd love to hear more about your learning strategies, but first here's today's quiz question for you. What's the word for a system, such as use of special poems or rhymes to help you remember something? Is it \u2026<br/>a) pneumatics<br/>b) mnemonics<br/>Or c) hypnotics?<br/><br/><strong>Rob<br/></strong>I'll go for b) mnemonics.<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well, we'll find out whether you got the answer right or not later on in the show. Now, according to current scientific research, some study methods popular with students aren't actually very effective.\u00a0\u00a0</p>, <p><span> </span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Don't tell me \u2013 putting your textbook under your pillow at night doesn't work.</p>, <p><span> </span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Did you try doing that, Rob?</p>, <p><span> </span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes, I did, but without much success. Maybe I was using the wrong kind of pillow?!<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well, let's talk about more conventional methods than the book-under-the-pillow one. These include summarising, highlighting or underlining text to help you remember it\u2026 I do love a pack of highlighting pens, though.</p>, <p><span> </span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Oh yes, me too. And actually highlighting text was one of my top tips. But I used to get so absorbed with the highlighting I'm not sure I was actually learning anything useful. My notebooks were works of art, though!<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Yes, and that's the point made by John Dunlosky, Professor of Psychology at Kent State University in the US, who says that you need to do more than just highlight information. You need to test yourself on it. Let's hear from him now.<br/><br/><strong>INSERT<br/> John Dunlosky, Professor of Psychology at Kent State University in the US<br/></strong>Students who can basically test themselves or try to retrieve material from their memory are going to learn that material in the long run a lot better. So for instance maybe you start by reading a textbook using your favourite highlighter and favourite colours, but then you go back and make flashcards of all the critical concepts and instead of just rereading those, you basically try to test yourselves on them.<br/><br/><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Professor John Dunlosky there. So he says trying to memorise the material isn't enough. You need to do something with it, for example, making flashcards of <strong>critical</strong> \u2013 or important \u2013 concepts and then testing yourself on them.<strong><br/><br/></strong><strong>Alice<br/></strong>By repeatedly testing yourself on something, you strengthen the pathways between <strong>neurons</strong> \u2013 or nerve cells \u2013 in the brain. And the more often you do this, the easier it becomes to retrieve information.</p>, <p><span> </span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And <strong>retrieve</strong> means to get something back.</p>, <p><span> </span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>That's right. When you repeatedly test yourself over a longer period of time \u2013 for example, over months or weeks - this is called <strong>distributed practice</strong> \u2013 and psychologists believe this is a very effective way to learn.</p>, <p><span> </span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>It sounds like hard work, though, doesn't it? I prefer the <strong>cramming</strong> method \u2013 which means to try and learn lots of information in a short period of time. For example, the night before the exam.</p>, <p><span> </span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>I don't know, Rob. We don't cram to learn other things \u2013 like music or dancing, or football or language learning. It's far more effective to join a conversation class and practise speaking every week than to practise for hours in front of the mirror the night before your oral exam!</p>, <p><span> </span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>That's a good point. In fact, I used to sing irregular French verbs to myself, every day in the shower for weeks before my French exam, and that helped me remember them more easily.</p>, <p><span> </span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Excellent! Making different types of associations with what you're trying to learn \u2013 for example, musical associations \u2013 is meant to be effective. Let's listen now to Professor Dunlovsky talking about visual associations.</p>, <p><span> </span><strong>INSERT<br/> John Dunlosky, Professor of Psychology at Kent State University in the US<br/></strong>I would encourage students as they are reading to try and elaborate mentally using images, as they're reading, to kind of develop a more vivid picture of what they're reading. Again, that'll help quite a bit for some kinds of studies \u2013 maybe history and so forth \u2013 and a little bit less so for more conceptual studies.</p>, <p><span> </span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And if you <strong>elaborate</strong> on something, it means you add more information \u2013 in this case, mental pictures.</p>, <p><span> </span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>So, creating mental pictures is useful for some subjects \u2013 like history or languages. But <strong>conceptual</strong> subjects \u2013 ones based on abstract ideas rather than things \u2013 like maths, for example \u2013 it might not be so easy to associate ideas with pictures.</p>, <p><span> </span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Now what about Albert Einstein? People say he was a very visual thinker.</p>, <p><span> </span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well, you've got me there, Rob. I don't know the answer to that but I can give you the answer to today's quiz question. I asked: What's the word for a system, such as use of special poems or rhymes to help you remember something? Is it \u2026 a) pneumatics, b) mnemonics or c) hypnotics?</p>, <p><span> </span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>I said mnemonics.</p>, <p><span> </span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>And you were right!</p>, <p><span> </span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Great!</p>, <p><span> </span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well done! Research on mnemonics suggests they are a good strategy for learning certain kinds of things, like how to spell difficult words. For example, the first letters of this sentence: '<strong>b</strong>ig <strong>e</strong>lephants <strong>c</strong>ause <strong>a</strong>ccidents <strong>u</strong>nder <strong>s</strong>mall <strong>e</strong>lephants' spells 'because'. Now, do you think you can remember the words we heard today, Rob?</p>, <p><span> </span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>We heard:<br/>revise<br/>critical<br/>neurons<br/>retrieve<br/>distributed practice<br/>cramming<br/>elaborate<br/>conceptual</p>, <p><span> </span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

But I got pretty good at it as a barman. They didn't have computerized cash registers in my day, you see.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>I didn't realize you were <em>that</em> old, Rob! Anyway, the subject of today's show is young business entrepreneurs. So, can you answer this question: How young were the founders of Facebook and Microsoft when they first set up their companies? Were they\u2026<br/>a) junior high-school students<br/>b) high-school students<br/>Or c) university students?</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And Alice in case you think I don't know, Facebook is an online social networking service and Microsoft is a computer software company. OK?</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well done!</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well I'm going to say they were b) high-school students.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>We'll find out if you chose the right answer later on in the programme. But let's talk now about what <strong>drawbacks</strong> \u2013 or disadvantages \u2013 there are for young entrepreneurs. What do you think, Rob?</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Hmm. Well, I suppose one of the drawbacks of being young and your own boss is that everyone who works for you is older than you!</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Is that a drawback?</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well, let's consider a real case. Young British entrepreneur Suleman Sacranie started his first company when he was 17, followed by another business shortly afterwards. Then whilst studying chemistry at university he started his third company, an online version of the pound shop \u2013 or dollar store in the US \u2013 where everything in the shop is priced at one pound. Let's listen to Suleman Sacranie talking about his company.</p>, <p><strong>INSERT<br/> Suleman Sacranie, founder of online wholesaler 99pwholesaler.com<br/></strong>I'm actually quite fortunate now, compared to what I was six months ago because now I've got two additional directors who have grey hair. It actually\u2026 commercial meetings are excellent now, you know. But before that I think I came across quite professional but you could still tell they were thinking in the back of their heads, 'I've got a kid sitting in front of me.'<br/><br/><strong>Rob<br/></strong>So young entrepreneur Suleman Sacranie has got two grey-haired directors working with him now.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>That's right \u2013 but how does having grey-haired executives on board help, Rob?</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well, '<strong>executives</strong>' are people who run a business and <strong>on board</strong> means being part of a team. Well, to answer your question, Alice, they bring experience to the table. I have a few grey hairs you know \u2013 you could learn a lot from me.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>I do, Rob. Everyday. And if you<strong> bring something to the table </strong>it means you provide something useful. Well, what do you bring to the table, Rob?</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well, bad jokes, peanuts, crisps, cups of coffee, that sort of thing\u2026</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>I was going to say a <strong>keen</strong> mind, in other words, a well-developed mind, and\u2026 great business acumen!</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Come on, you weren't going to say that!</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>You're right, I wasn't. <strong>Acumen</strong> means good judgement. But don't worry, you have an abundant enthusiasm that makes up for it. But moving on now, do you think that school prepared you well for working life?</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>No, not really. I studied Latin at school, and I don't use that much. And maths \u2013 well, I never use trigonometry or calculus. So I'm not sure how useful maths lessons were\u2026</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Yes, and you only learned to add up in the university bar after all\u2026</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes, but I am very good at it! And the point is that I've got a fantastic job now. And if you're really interested in something you can always <strong>acquire</strong> \u2013 or get \u2013 the skills you don't have. Let's listen to successful young entrepreneur Jessica Rose talking about her experience. She works with jewellery.</p>, <p><strong>INSERT<br/> Jessica Rose, owner of a jewellery making business<br/></strong>I didn't need all these previous skills and experience to go out there and start on my own. When I first started I had no business training whatsoever, no jewellery training whatsoever, but I kind of woke up one day and thought I'd really love to be a jewellery designer. Which is kind of a tricky position to be in, because it's you know, a lot of people would say and did say, well, you know, you're mad.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>So Jessica Rose used her savings to learn jewellery making and then set up her own jewellery-making business.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And despite setting out with no business experience and no jewellery training \u2013 her enthusiasm for the article <strong>paid off</strong>.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>And that means it was successful.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>A bit like me\u2026</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Yes. OK, I think it's time for the answer to today's quiz question. I asked: How young were the founders of Facebook and Microsoft when first set up their companies? Were they\u2026 a) junior high-school students, b) high-school students or c) university students?</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>I said b) high-school students.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>And you were wrong, I'm afraid, Rob. Sorry.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Again.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Yes. Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates were both university students when they started their companies. Zuckerberg was studying at Harvard in the US when he launched Facebook in 2004. And Bill Gates took a break from Harvard to launch Microsoft in 1976, but never returned to his studies.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Both at Harvard \u2013 that's a coincidence. I wonder if the bar there was any good\u2026 Now can we hear the words we learned today?</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Yes. OK. They are:<br/>drawbacks<br/>executives<br/>on board<br/>bring something to the table<br/>keen<br/>(business) acumen<br/>acquire<br/>paid off</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Thanks, Alice. Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

But Rob, aren't you a supporter of the movement to preserve the environment?</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Erm\u2026 Yes.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>A gas-guzzling car for an environmentalist, Rob? Isn't that a contradiction \u2013 aren't you being a hypocrite?</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well, it's very fuel-efficient, Alice. It's quite eco-friendly actually.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>That's ridiculous and you know it. Hypocrisy is the subject of today's show, and maybe we should start by exploring the meaning of hypocrite. Can you tell me what did the Ancient Greek word \u2018hypocrite' originally mean? Was it\u2026<br/>a) actor<br/>b) politician<br/>Or c) horse?</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>OK, that's easy. I think it's b) politician.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well, we'll find out whether you got the answer right or not later in the show. Now, these days the meaning has changed, and a <strong>hypocrite</strong> means somebody who says one thing and does another.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Like you telling me not to bite my nails because it's a disgusting habit\u2026 and then I see you doing it later the same day.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Hmm. Well, sometimes it's hard to be consistent. I do think nail biting is disgusting \u2013 but then when I'm a bit nervous I do it without thinking.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>We're often inconsistent in what we say or do, though, aren't we? <strong>Inconsistent</strong> means changeable.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>There is an explanation for us sometimes saying one thing and behaving in a very different way. Let's listen to Professor Clancy Martin at the University of Missouri in the US. He teaches Philosophy so he knows a thing or two about the way we think.</p>, <p><strong>INSERT<br/> Clancy Martin, Professor of Philosophy at the University of Missouri in Kansas City, US<br/></strong>So while you might be enormously compassionate in your role as a teacher or a parent, you might find yourself being quite harsh and direct when it comes to your role as a brother or a sister. So then you see that - now wait a second if I've got all these inconsistencies all over the place in my character can I really say that I'm a sincere and authentic individual? Or am I just kind of blowing with which ever way my relationship winds kind of incline me?</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Professor Clancy Martin. So we play different roles in life and these roles may seem contradictory but they're just part of being the same person. Sometimes you're a bit harsh and direct with me, Alice, aren't you? Do you see yourself as my sister? She used to pick on me.<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong><strong>Harsh </strong>means stern and unkind. I don't mean to be unkind to you, Rob. Maybe I could try and be more <strong>compassionate</strong> towards you \u2013 it means show a bit of sympathy and concern now and then.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Offer me good words. At least promise you'll be nice to me. That you'll bring me tea and biscuits\u2026</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>That's what politicians do. They promise they will do what people want and \u2026 often they don't. And it's a big problem for them. Let's talk about politicians and hypocrisy.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>They have to express opinions about so many things that it's easy to catch them out being hypocritical\u2026 \u2013 and then we, the public, get morally indignant about it.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Yes. To <strong>catch somebody out</strong> means to discover they have made a mistake. And <strong>morally indignant</strong> means being angry about something, according to principles of right and wrong. Let's listen to Professor Martin again talking about the difficulties of being a politician.</p>, <p><strong>INSERT<br/> Clancy Martin, Professor of Philosophy at the University of Missouri in Kansas City, US<br/></strong>I think in our contemporary democracy it's become obvious to most of us that the views that we expect from our politicians and the kinds of views that get our politicians elected are\u2026 may be completely incongruous with the way they lead their personal lives and what they personally believe. And this is how it can become very morally pernicious\u2026 very morally dangerous.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>OK, so we elect politicians based on their views \u2013 for example on the environment, on education, on foreign policy. But their public views may be <strong>incongruous</strong> \u2013 or not in agreement with \u2013 their personal views.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And the difference between their public and personal views can be <strong>pernicious</strong> - it means deadly or destructive.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Politicians are under scrutiny all the time \u2013 their personal lives, their public statements... Now with social media, a thoughtless comment <strong>goes viral</strong> \u2013 or spreads very quickly via the internet.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>That's true. And actually\u2026 I posted a photo of my red pick-up truck earlier.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Has it gone viral, Rob?</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>No, but there is a negative comment from the local conservationists\u2026</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Oh dear. Well, Rob, I think it's time I told you the answer to today's quiz question. I asked: What did the Ancient Greek word 'hypocrite' originally describe? Was it\u2026 a) actor, b) politician or c) horse.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And I said b) politician.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>And you were wrong, I'm afraid! <em>Hypokrites</em> was a technical term for a stage actor and was not considered an appropriate role for a public figure. In Athens in the 4th century BC, the great orator Demosthenes ridiculed a rival politician, who had been a successful actor. Well, we're running out of time so can we hear the words we learned today?</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>They are:<br/>hypocrite<br/>inconsistent<br/>harsh<br/>compassionate<br/>catch somebody out<br/>morally indignant<br/>incongruous<br/>pernicious<br/>go viral</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

I'm Alice\u2026</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span><span> </span></strong><span>\u2026 And I'm Rob. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>So Rob, what job did you want to do when you were little?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>I really wanted to be an astronaut. Be in orbit, watching the Earth from afar\u2026</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Wow! Be <strong>in orbit</strong></span><span> - it means be in space and following the Earth's curvature. Well, the view must be nice from up there. But the reality of becoming an astronaut is pretty hard. And it's the subject of today's show! Did you know that less than 600 people have been into space so far?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>I'd like to have been one of them. I know I have what it takes to be a spaceman!</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Yes. There are many others like you who would like to go for this job, Rob. And that's the quiz question for you today. How many people have applied to join Nasa's 2017 astronaut class? Was it\u2026<br/></span><span><br/></span>a) 800<br/>b) 8,000<br/><span>Or c) 18,000 people?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Mmmm\u2026 8,000 sounds like a lot already so I'll go for b) 8,000 people.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Well, we'll find out if you chose the right answer later on in the programme. So, what do you think is the biggest challenge when considering becoming an astronaut?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Well, I'd say <strong>claustrophobia</strong></span><span> \u2013 and that means: fear of being in a small space. That might be a problem because the space capsules are small and you're with the same people for months at a time. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, that's right. Well, astronauts are bound to get on each other's nerves sometimes! To <strong>get on someone's nerves</strong></span><span> means: to annoy them.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>But I'm a great team player\u2026 so I think I'll be OK.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, I can confirm that. Anyway, the challenge of being an astronaut doesn't stop here. In the space capsule, astronauts have to put up with extremely difficult conditions. Like zero gravity, for example. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>It looks like doing somersaults in the capsule and catching bits of food in your mouth as it floats out of its packet\u2026 </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>But<strong> zero gravity</strong> \u2013 a condition where gravity is exerting no force \u2013 can lead to wasting of the bones and muscles. Astronauts take two and a half hours of\u00a0exercise per day to help prevent this. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>But what do astronauts have to do before they go into space to prepare themselves for weightlessness and spacewalking?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>They can practice using a virtual reality headset and special gloves. It's like playing a computer game that looks and feels like doing a spacewalk. And they also train in a swimming pool! Let's listen to Major Tim Peake, a British astronaut, talking about the preparation he did for his mission on the International Space Station. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>INSERT<br/></span><span> Major Tim Peake, British astronaut with the European Space Agency<br/></span></strong><span>The way we practise spacewalk is in water. Water gives us the neutral buoyancy that we need. So we sink training modules into swimming pools and then practise the spacewalking on them. We wear very specific equipment, a pressurized spacesuit \u2013 very difficult to move in actually \u2013 it's hard to bend the fingers, it's hard to bend your arms \u2013 and it really gives you quite a difficult workout. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>British astronaut Tim Peake says water gives us <strong>buoyancy</strong>, which is the ability to float. Floating in space is similar to floating in water, so astronauts practise their spacewalk in swimming pools. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Yes. They take to the water and to the air too. Astronauts experience the feeling of weightlessness in planes. </span><span>A large plane with padded walls flies to high altitude and then goes into a <strong>nosedive</strong></span><span> \u2013 or a fast and sudden fall \u2013 which creates short periods of weightlessness. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Fabulous! I'd love to do that!</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>But it's not all fun and games. Don't forget that one of the main reasons for being out on the International Space Station is to conduct research. Major Tim Peake is doing scientific experiments such as how to grow plants in space, and what effect radiation and zero gravity have on this process.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Like that film where an astronaut gets <strong>stranded</strong></span><span> \u2013 or left behind \u2013 on Mars and has to grow potatoes. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Yes.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>The film is called The Martian.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>That's right. Yes. So do you think you have what it takes to survive in a challenging environment, Rob? Let's listen to Major Tim Peake talking about his </span><span>survival training.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>INSERT<br/></span><span> Major Tim Peak, British astronaut with the European Space Agency<br/></span></strong><span>Survival training: for this year the European Space Agency sends us to Sardinia. When you land in the Soyuz capsule sometimes you might not land exactly where you expect to be. Foraging for food, for example, and your basic elements of shelter and protection, getting water\u2026 Go and live in a cave for seven days with an international crew. And it's a wonderful environment to prepare you for a mission because you are very isolated.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>So astronauts may get stranded on Earth \u2013 when the space capsule lands somewhere unexpected. And they have to find food. <strong>Forage</strong> means to search. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>It's a word we often use to describe how animals search for food.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Indeed. Well, let's go back to that quiz question you asked me earlier, Alice. I'm keen to know how many people want to live this experience of being an astronaut.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>OK. Well, I asked: How many people have applied to join NASA's 2017 astronaut class? Was it\u2026 a) 800, b) 8,000 or c) 18,000 people?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>And I said quite a lot: b) 8,000 people.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>And you were wrong, I'm afraid! According to Nasa's website, more than 18,300 people applied to join their 2017 astronaut class. This is almost three times the number of applications received in 2012 for the most recent astronaut class. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Wow! So there's no chance of me ever succeeding. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Oh, well, you mustn't give up, Rob. Anyway, we are running out of time so here are the words we heard today:<br/></span><span>in orbit<br/></span><span>claustrophobia<br/></span><span>get on someone's nerves<br/></span><span>zero gravity<br/></span><span>buoyancy<br/></span><span>nosedive<br/></span><span>stranded<br/></span><span>forage</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

I'm Alice\u2026</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span><span> </span></strong><span>\u2026 And I'm Rob. Alice, I read in the paper recently that the substance called 'fluoride' might be bad for our health. But it's in nearly every brand of toothpaste, isn't it?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>You shouldn't believe everything you hear, Rob.

I wonder about this too\u2026 Apparently, in the 1960s television footage of the moon landing, the American flag is fluttering \u2013 and there's no air on the moon so the US government must've faked it!</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><strong><span>To fake</span></strong><span> <strong>something</strong></span><span> means to make something that isn't true appear to be real. I didn't realize you were so </span><strong><span>gullible</span></strong><span> Rob \u2013 and that means easily persuaded to believe something. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>I just like to question things. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Oh, I see\u2026</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>I have a healthy distrust of authority, Alice. And today we're talking about conspiracy theories \u2013 a <strong>conspiracy theory</strong></span><span> is a belief that some organization or group of people is responsible for a situation or event through secret planning.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>We'll talk more about how healthy this type of distrust might be later on in the show. But now please focus your intellectual powers on today's quiz question, Rob. Around what proportion of the US population believes that the assassination of President John F Kennedy was not the result of a lone </span><span>gunman? Is it\u2026</span></p>, <p><span>a) 6%?<br/></span><span>b) 16%?<br/></span><span>Or c) 60%?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>I'll go for b) 16%. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Well, we'll find out if you chose the right answer later on in the programme. But for now let's move on. Let's talk about what types of people are thought to be <strong>susceptible to</strong></span><span> \u2013 or likely to be influenced by \u2013 conspiracy theories. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>The stereotype is of a loner, maybe male, middle aged, sitting in front of the computer. But in actual fact this isn't true. People of all ages and from all social classes are susceptible to conspiracy theories. Lots of us worry that important things are being covered up \u2013 and a <strong>cover-up</strong></span><span> means an attempt to prevent the public from discovering information about something important.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Let's listen now to Professor Chris French from Goldsmiths, a college within the University of London, talking more about people who believe in conspiracy theories.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>INSERT<br/></span><span> Chris French, Professor of Psychology at Goldsmiths, University of London<br/></span></strong><span>There are quite a few personality dimensions that seem to be related to belief in conspiracy theories and not surprisingly paranoia is one of them; also openness to new ideas \u2013 people who are willing to entertain ideas that are kind of off the beaten track. People who believe in conspiracy theories tend to believe in the paranormal.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>That was Professor Chris French. So he says that paranoia is a personality <strong>trait</strong></span><span> \u2013 or quality \u2013 that leads some people to believe in conspiracy theories. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span><strong>Paranoia</strong> is a strong and unreasonable feeling that other people don't like you or want to harm you.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>And ideas that are <strong>off the beaten track</strong></span><span> are those which are unusual and aren't shared by many other people. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Believing in the <strong>paranormal</strong> means believing in strange things that can't be explained by science, for example, ghosts.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Ghosts, yes. Do you believe in them, Alice?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>No, Rob, I don't. How about you?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Well, maybe.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Moving on. Most of the time believing in conspiracy theories is quite harmless and might even be good \u2013 because we shouldn't just accept everything that we're told. But there can also be serious consequences. Let's hear more from Professor French on this.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>INSERT<br/></span><span> Chris French, Professor of Psychology at Goldsmiths, University of London<br/></span></strong><span>Studies have shown that people are less likely to engage with the political process. People who accept medically based conspiracies are likely to avoid getting their kids vaccinated. And even terrorist acts \u2013 it's been shown that terrorist groups will actually use conspiracy theories as both a means to get new recruits and also to motivate people to carry out extreme terrorist acts.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>So the toothpaste thing I mentioned at the beginning of the show is a medically based conspiracy theory? </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Yes.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>But more serious examples are parents choosing not to vaccinate their children against diseases because of <strong>unsubstantiated</strong></span><span> ideas that they are harmful \u2013 'unsubstantiated' means 'not supported by evidence'.</span><span>\u00a0 </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>That's right. OK, now remember the question I asked earlier, Rob? Around what proportion of the US population believes that the assassination of President John F Kennedy wasn't the result of a lone gunman? Is it\u2026 a) 6%, b) 16% or c) 60%?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Well, I said b) 16%.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>And you were wrong today, Rob, I'm afraid. The answer is actually c) 60%. And this statistic comes from a Gallup poll from 2013 that suggests a clear majority of Americans still believe others, besides the gunman Lee Harvey Oswald, were involved. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>That's more than I expected. But they might have a point.</span></p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>There you go again\u2026 Come on, Rob. Now let me remind everybody what words we've heard today. They are:</p>, <p>to fake something<br/>gullible<br/>conspiracy theory<br/>susceptible<br/>cover-up<br/>trait<br/>paranoia<br/>off the beaten track<br/>paranormal<br/>unsubstantiated</p>, <p><strong><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">Rob<br/></span></strong><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">That's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

I'm Alice\u2026</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/> </strong>And I'm Rob. Now, Alice, what did you get up to at the weekend?</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>I did some <strong>spring-cleaning</strong>, which means <span>cleaning a place very well, especially places you don't clean often</span>. So, I was tidying up my wardrobe, trying to organise things\u2026 and suddenly hundreds of shoes tumbled on my head!</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Poor Alice! But why do you have so many shoes? And why do you keep them at the top of your wardrobe? I only have three pairs.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>I like to match my shoes to my outfit \u2013 and three pairs wouldn't do the trick. Well, the subject of today's show is having too much stuff. And you're making me feel guilty, Rob. You must have too much of something.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes, plastic bags. I think they're useful, but they're getting <strong>out of hand</strong> \u2013 and that means not under control. They're taking over my kitchen!</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>You can recycle plastic bags, you know, Rob?</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well, you can recycle shoes too, you know, Alice!</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Yes.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Now, usually I don't have a lot of <strong>clutter</strong> in my flat \u2013 and that means an untidy collection of objects. Clutter makes it harder to find the things you need. And it makes moving house a nightmare! All those boxes full of things you don't need\u2026</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Good point. I have a friend who suggested the three buckets system. You sort things into three different buckets: one you label as 'to keep', one as 'to get rid of', one as 'maybe to get rid of'. <strong>Get rid of</strong>, by the way, means to remove something you don't want. It's the 'maybe' bucket that's tricky, isn't it? \u2013 You never know if you might need something in the future.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes, it would need to be a big bucket too.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Yes, it would.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well, l think we could all live better with less. OK, well, let's have today's quiz question before we talk more about de-cluttering our lives: So which word, Alice, means a belief that physical possessions are the most important thing in life? Is it\u2026<br/>a) metaphysics?<br/>b) materialism?<br/>Or c) existentialism?</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>OK\u2026 I think it's b) materialism.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>OK. Well, we'll find out if you got the answer right or wrong later on in the show. Now let's listen to Bea Johnson, author of <em>Zero Waste Home</em> talking about how she and her family have adopted a <strong>minimalist</strong> \u2013 or deliberately simple \u2013 lifestyle in their California home.</p>, <p><strong>INSERT<br/> Bea Johnson, minimalist and author of <em>Zero Waste Home<br/></em></strong>We've really asked ourselves 'what is it that we really need?' We've asked really true questions, and evaluated every single thing that we have. There is nothing that we overlooked. I even came to one day look at my vegetable peeler for example and asked myself, 'Do I really need that vegetable peeler'?</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>So one day Bea Johnson decided to <strong>evaluate</strong>, or to judge the importance of something, to see if she needed it.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>She evaluated her vegetable peeler and decided to put it in the 'get rid of' bucket!</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes, and to <strong>overlook</strong> something means not to see it. Now, I don't blame Bea at all because I don't like peeling vegetables either. And you could actually get the benefit of the vitamins and minerals by eating the skins.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Very healthy, Rob!</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>We can really live with fewer things. But some people can't help looking for the latest version of something or go for designer goods. Writer and journalist James Wallman warns us about this. He wonders how much stuff is too much.</p>, <p><strong>INSERT<br/> James Wallman, writer and journalist<br/></strong>This thing about need is such a dangerous term because what do you need? And I'm not anti-stuff \u2013 stuff is good. I'm anti too much stuff and I'm anti the wrong stuff. Don't go out and buy that labelled good that you think is going to make people think something more of you. That's not going to make you happy.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>James Wallman there. Now, Alice, do you buy labelled goods?</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>I'm afraid I do. And <strong>labelled</strong> goods or products are the ones with a famous brand name, like Gucci, Dior, Prada etc. But I do think James Wallman is right \u2013 buying things just because other people have them, for example, doesn't make us happy.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yeah, that's true, but as he says, not everything is the wrong stuff. For example, I'm very fond of my large schoolboy collection of superhero comics. I might not need them, but they make me happy. So what stuff makes you happy, Alice?</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Oh, well, I like my music CDs and my books \u2013 even though I've got the music on an mp3 player and I don't often pull a book out from the bookcase.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>They have <strong>sentimental value</strong>, don't they?</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Yes.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And that means the importance of something because of a personal or emotional feeling that we attach to it. Well, I sold all my music CDs online ages ago.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>That sounds like the sensible thing to do. OK, I think it's time for the answer to today's quiz question, Rob.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes, I asked you: Which word means a belief that physical possessions are the most important thing in life? Is it\u2026 a) metaphysics, b) materialism or c) existentialism?</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>I said b) materialism.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And you were right, Alice! Well done! The answer is indeed b) materialism.

I'm Alice\u2026</p>, <p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>And I'm Rob\u2026</p>, <p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>You look very pale, Rob. Are you OK?</p>, <p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>Well, I was at a rather boozy wedding party last night. And I had a bit too much champagne. Do you know any good hangover cures?</p>, <p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>A<strong> hangover</strong> is the headache and sickness you can feel after drinking too much alcohol. And a <strong>cure</strong> is something that makes you better. Well, I'm <strong>teetotal</strong> \u2013 I don't drink alcohol. So, I'd say the best hangover cure is not to drink in the first place.</p>, <p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>You don't believe in hair of the dog then?</p>, <p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>No, Rob, I don't. <strong>Hair of the dog</strong> is the belief that drinking more alcohol when you already have a hangover will make you feel better! And <strong>boozy</strong> means lots of alcohol.</p>, <p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>I can see I'm not going to get much sympathy from you. So I'm going to take a couple of painkillers and let you tell everyone what the subject of today's show is.</p>, <p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>Alright then. Well, it's drinking too much, Rob. And I have a question for you. What is the name of the main process involved in producing alcohol? Is it\u2026<br/>a) fermentation?<br/>b) hydration?<br/>Or c) purification?</p>, <p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>OK, I know it has something to do with water so I'm going to go for b) hydration. It rings a bell from chemistry lessons at school.</p>, <p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>Well, we'll find out later on in the show whether you were listening carefully in class, Rob.</p>, <p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>Well, er\u2026 no comment.</p>, <p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>Well, most people are aware of the links between smoking and cancer, but fewer are aware that drinking alcohol is linked to an increased risk of future health problems. The UK government is currently trying to raise awareness with their new guidelines on how much it's safe to drink. Let's hear what Dr Michael Moseley has to say about health risks.</p>, <p><strong>INSERT</strong><br/><strong>Dr Michael Moseley, Science journalist and TV presenter</strong><br/>Unfortunately whatever level of alcohol you are drinking it is likely to increase your risk of some forms of cancer, particularly breast cancer, but also other rarer forms of cancer like head, neck, and the throat. The rest are quite low at moderate drinking but they do rise rapidly.</p>, <p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>So any drinking at all \u2013 even one small glass of wine with your evening meal \u2013 raises your risk of cancer? Is that right?</p>, <p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>Yes. And the health risk increases with the amount you drink.</p>, <p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>But I thought wine was supposed to be good for you?</p>, <p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>It's a popular belief, but medical evidence doesn't seem to support this view. Let's listen to Dr Michael Moseley again on this.</p>, <p><strong>INSERT</strong><br/><strong>Dr Michael Moseley, Science journalist and TV presenter</strong><br/>Now there's long been this idea there is this marvellous stuff in red wine called 'resveratrol' which is said to reduce your risk of all sorts of things. Unfortunately the amount you'd have to consume would be so huge that the downsides of drinking red wine would swiftly overwhelm them.</p>, <p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>And the<strong> downside</strong> of something means the disadvantages. Now Alice, what's your favourite tipple?</p>, <p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>Well, I don't have one Rob because I'm teetotal, remember? A <strong>tipple</strong> is another way of saying 'an alcoholic drink'. I enjoy beetroot and kale smoothies with a dash of turmeric and ground pepper.</p>, <p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>Kale? Yuk, that's disgusting! Now, a smoothie is a thick drink made of fruit or vegetables blended with milk or yogurt or water. Well, I like sweet stuff\u2026 maybe a banana smoothie with some honey, but beetroot and kale sounds disgusting!</p>, <p><strong>Alice</strong><br/><strong>Don't knock it until you've tried it</strong>. And that means to try something before you criticize it.</p>, <p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>OK, OK, but seriously. A glass of wine makes me happy and relaxed. And there are health studies that suggest being happy is good for your health.</p>, <p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>That's true, but eating and drinking healthily makes me happy! Now moving on, it's important to put the risk of drinking alcohol\u2026</p>, <p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>\u2026or horrible vegetable smoothies\u2026</p>, <p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>\u2026 in context. Statistically, drinking alcohol regularly represents just under 1% lifetime risk of death. But actually an hour of TV watching or eating a bacon sandwich a couple of times a week is more dangerous.</p>, <p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>Well, that's what I like to hear! Though\u2026 what if I'm watching TV, enjoying a beer and a lovely bacon sandwich, does that triple my lifetime risk of death?</p>, <p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>Well, Rob, you better ask Professor David Spiegelhalter at the University of Cambridge that question. I was quoting him earlier about the TV watching and the bacon sandwich. He works with statistics, but this is for another programme. Now, let's get on to the serious matter of today's quiz question. I asked: What is the name of the main process involved in producing alcohol? Is it\u2026 a) fermentation, b) hydration or c) purification?</p>, <p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>Well, I said b) hydration. Though you were <strong>sceptical</strong>, weren't you, Alice?</p>, <p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>Yes. And I was right to be sceptical, which means 'doubtful', because b) is the wrong answer I'm afraid, Rob. The main process involved in producing alcohol is <strong>fermentation</strong>, which is the process in which yeast or bacteria changes sugar into alcohol. Hydration is the process of making your body absorb water. And purification is the act of removing some harmful things from something. Actually, have this glass of water, Rob. Hydration is a good hangover cure \u2013 much better than hair of the dog.</p>, <p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>Cheers, Alice!</p>, <p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>Now let's hear the words we learned today.</p>, <p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>They are:<br/>hangover<br/>cure<br/>teetotal<br/>hair of the dog<br/>boozy<br/>downside<br/>tipple<br/>don't knock it until you've tried it<br/>sceptical<br/>fermentation</p>, <p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

I'm Neil\u2026</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>\u2026 And I'm Alice. My chair feels [audibly shifts about in her chair] uncomfortable today. How does yours feel?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Um\u2026 mine is fine - very comfortable, thank you.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well, it would be nice if you offered to give me your chair, Neil.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>What? No chance. Well, I would be uncomfortable then, wouldn't I?</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>You should give me your seat, Neil.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Should I? Well, now might be a good time to mention that chivalry is the subject of today's show.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong><strong>Chivalry</strong> these days means polite behaviour usually by men towards women.<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Though in the past it referred to a code of behaviour followed by knights in the Middle Ages. It was all about honour and courage in battle \u2013 and only later on about being polite to the ladies. Well, we aren't living in the Middle Ages any more, are we?</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/> </strong>No comment. Let's go for our traditional question. I have a literary one for you today: Who wrote the novel <em>Don Quixote</em>, about a 50-year old man travelling Spain in search of knightly adventures in rusty armour and a cardboard helmet? Was it\u2026<br/>a) Miguel de Cervantes<br/>b) Leo Tolstoy<br/>Or c) William Shakespeare?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I think - I'm going to get it right today, Alice \u2013 I'm going to say a) Miguel de Cervantes.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well, we'll find out later on in the show if you were right or not. But first, do you think chivalry is dead, Neil?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>No, not at all \u2013 these traditions are alive and kicking \u2013 in Poland at any rate. If something is <strong>alive and kicking</strong> it means it's active. The BBC reporter Adam Easton saw it with his own eyes and is going to describe it for us.</p>, <p><strong>INSERT<br/> Adam Easton, BBC reporter<br/></strong>Medieval knights' tournaments or battle re-enactments are popular across Europe. But there's something about dressing up as a knight that particularly appeals to people here in Poland. In the summer there's events every weekend and here in Malbork Northern Poland home to Europe's largest medieval castle there's one of the biggest of the season. There's archery, crossbow, jousting, other horse skills, and more than a hundred thousand people come to watch these tournaments.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>The BBC reporter Adam Easton. By the way, what's a <strong>re-enactment</strong>, Neil?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>It's where you perform the actions of a past event. And in Malbork in Poland they stage battle re-enactments every weekend apparently \u2013 at least in the summer months!</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Mmm\u2026 it doesn't sound like <strong>my cup of tea</strong> \u2013 and that means it doesn't sound like something I would enjoy doing \u2013 how about you, Neil?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, I'm not sure about the archery, crossbow and jousting. It all sounds like too much hard work. But I'd definitely enjoy the dressing up.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Excellent! Well,<strong> jousting</strong> is where two people fight on horseback using a <strong>lance</strong> \u2013 or long pole \u2013 to try to knock the other person off their horse, especially as part of a <strong>tournament</strong> \u2013 or sporting event. So with the dressing up, Neil \u2013 I'm curious. I can't imagine you as a knight in shining armour, to be honest\u2026</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Come on, Alice. I'd look very appealing to any damsel in distress. A <strong>damsel in distress</strong> is a young unmarried woman in need of help.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>OK. You might make a very <strong>fetching</strong> \u2013 or attractive \u2013 knight, Neil. But you should get used to actually helping the ladies \u2026 maybe offering me your seat. I'm still sitting uncomfortably here\u2026</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Come on, Alice, a knight needs to sit comfortably too. We've always been the ones with battles to fight!</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>But at some point in the history of chivalry \u2013 <strong>prowess</strong> \u2013 or skill \u2013 on the battlefield became combined with a set of <strong>conventions</strong> \u2013 or rules \u2013 governing other aspects of behaviour. This included a knight's moral and religious duties and how to conduct their love affairs. Professor Laura Ashe at Oxford University explains.</p>, <p><strong>INSERT<br/> Laura Ashe, Associate Professor in English at the University of Oxford, UK<br/></strong>The really strange thing is the idea that love should somehow make you a better knight. I mean, this is what is suddenly claimed in the late 12th century and it makes very little sense, you know, if you imagine a footballer telling his teammates that being in love makes him a better footballer.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>That was Professor Laura Ashe. And I agree with her. What has being a great footballer or a great warrior got to do with love?</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well, <strong>courtly love </strong>was a social code governing behaviour between aristocratic men and women that developed at the same time and amongst the same people as chivalry and the two became <strong>intertwined</strong> \u2013 or hard to separate \u2013 from then on.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And <strong>aristocrats</strong> are people of high social rank. OK Alice, I think it's time you told us the answer to today's quiz question.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Good idea. OK. I asked: Who wrote the novel <em>Don Quixote</em>, about a 50-year old man travelling Spain in search of knightly adventures in rusty armour and a cardboard helmet? Was it\u2026 a) Miguel de Cervantes, b) LeonTolstoy or c) William Shakespeare?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I said a) Miguel de Cervantes.</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>And you were right! Well done! <em>Don Quixote</em> was written by Miguel de Cervantes and published in 1605. It's a comic novel which describes what happens to an elderly knight who, his head muddled by reading too many romances, sets out on his old horse with his companion Sancho Panza, to seek adventure.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Very interesting, Alice. Now can we hear the words we learned today?</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Sure, they are:<br/>chivalry<br/>alive and kicking<br/>re-enactment<br/>my cup of tea<br/>jousting<br/>lance<br/>tournament<br/>fetching<br/>damsel in distress<br/>prowess<br/>conventions<br/>courtly love<br/>intertwined<br/>aristocrats</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

That's another way of saying stay up all night to finish something. That's what students do to get their work done. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>I used to be able to do it, and now I couldn't. I struggle to stay up on New Year's Eve until midnight. But let's move on to today's quiz question. What percentage of people aged over 65 surveyed in the UK described themselves as old? Is it \u2026<br/></span><span>a) 6%?<br/></span><span>b) 16%?<br/></span><span>Or c) 60%?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Well, I think it's just a) 6%. People don't like to think of themselves as old.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Well, we'll find out if you got the answer right or wrong later on in the show. First, let's explore the subject of aging more. Tell me, Rob, do you think you can be too old to take up a new hobby?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span><span> </span></strong><span>I might be, I mean, depends on the hobby of course. I went for a run the other day, and it nearly killed me. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>That just means you're unfit, Rob! Let's listen to Ernestine Shepherd who didn't think she was too old to take up an interesting new hobby. At the age of 71 she started bodybuilding and is currently listed in the Guinness Book of Records as the oldest female bodybuilder in the world. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>INSERT<br/></span><span> Ernestine Shepherd, bodybuilder<br/></span></strong><span>If ever there were an anti-aging pill, I would call it exercise. I enjoy working out with the people who come to the church. Sometimes they say, \"Oh, this hurts!\" But I tell people, \"Age is nothing but a number!\" I am 75 years of age. This morning I awakened at 2.30. I have a group of four other people who run with me in the mornings. We run about ten miles. Every day. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Wow! That was Ernestine Shepherd. What an example to us all! </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span><strong>Work out</strong>, by the way, means taking exercise to make yourself fit. I think it's true that if we did more exercise every day, we would all look and feel much better.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Ernestine is all for exercise but I'm afraid I'd take some anti-aging pill if one existed. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>If something is advertised as being <strong>anti-aging</strong></span><span> it means it's designed to stop you looking older. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>And you can find hundreds of products these days that claim to have anti-aging properties. Lots of lotions and potions for women in particular! </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Yes. That's because women feel pressurized to look younger than their age. It's an example of ageism and it isn't fair.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span><strong>Ageism</strong> means discrimination against people because of their age. And sometimes people can be discriminated against in the workplace for being 'too old'. Now, do you think you could be too old to take up a new job, Alice?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>No, I don't get the concept of too old at all. My grandparents both still work and they have more enthusiasm and energy than I do. They hate being called <strong>senior citizens\u00a0</strong></span><span>and</span><strong><span> old-age pensioners</span></strong><span> - or by the initials of these words, </span><span><strong>OAP</strong>. And they are right: who wants to be defined by their age?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>You just said: \"Don't get this concept\". And to <strong>get something</strong></span><span> means to understand it. </span><span>\u00a0</span><span>So I suppose you stay the same inside \u2013 it's just the outside that changes! We have to be young at heart at least. And age is no reason for some people to stop working if they are in good health. Let's listen to Trisha Cusden who started a new business at 65 supplying beauty products for older women. Her age actually inspired her choice of work.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>INSERT<br/></span><span> Trisha Cusden, founder of Look Fabulous Forever<br/></span></strong><span>I've had an idea, I've seen a problem and an opportunity, and I've done something about it \u2013 And created a business which I'm very happy to say is very successful. I mean [when] I started it, it was going to be a hobby, you know, something to keep me out of trouble, give me something to do.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Trisha Cusden there. She started a new hobby and it turned into a successful business enterprise. Now, before we finish, I'd just like to put the case for older men. My dad, my granddad, Sean Connery, Michael Caine, Harrison Ford \u2013 they're all fantastic role models for us younger guys. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>And a <strong>role model</strong></span><span> is somebody people admire and want to copy.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Well, that brings us round to the matter of today's quiz question, Alice.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, it does. I asked: What percentage of people aged over 65 surveyed in the UK described themselves as old in a survey? Is it \u2026 a) 6%, b) 16% or c) 60%?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Yep. And I said a) 6%. Was I right?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, you were! You were right! Well done!

I'm Sophie\u2026</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I'm Neil\u2026 Here's your coffee, Sophie.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>Neil \u2013 remember that staff meeting we had yesterday?\u00a0 Why did you agree to having decaff coffee in the kitchen when I know you don't like it\u2026 and neither do I!</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>I know. It's just that the boss said that\u00a0<strong>decaffeinated</strong> coffee \u2013 that's coffee with the caffeine removed \u2013 was a good idea, healthier, you know. And then everyone else agreed. And I\u2026 I don't know\u2026 I just felt uncomfortable disagreeing with everyone.</span></p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Well, it's interesting you should say that, Neil. Groupthink is the subject of today's show. <strong>Groupthink</strong> refers to the type of bad decisions we make when we are in a group. Decisions that are <strong>contrary to</strong> \u2013 or against \u2013 what we really think. A psychology experiment conducted in the 1950s showed that a lot of people do exactly that \u2013 they submit to the will of the group.</p>, <p><strong><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">Neil<br/></span></strong><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">But before we hear more about this, now would be a good time for today's quiz question. And I get to ask you, Sophie!</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>OK. What is it?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>In which story by Hans Christian Andersen does a young boy dare to tell the truth when everyone else goes along with an obvious lie? Is it\u2026<br/></span><span>a) The Red Shoes<br/></span><span>b) The Snow Queen<br/></span><span>Or c) The Emperor's New Clothes</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>OK\u2026 I think it's c) The Emperor's New Clothes.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, we'll find out later on in the show if that's right or not. Now, the psychologist Solomon Asch is well known for his conformity experiments from the 1950s. Can you tell us what \u2018conformity' means please, Sophie?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span><strong>Conformity</strong> means behaviour that is the same as the way most other people behave. Asch's main finding was that group pressure can change a person's opinion, of even obvious facts.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And what did this Asch test involve?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>123 male participants were shown a card with a line on it, followed by another card with three lines on it. The participants were then asked to say which line matched the line on the first card in length. The right answer was plain to see, but the participants felt pressurized into saying the wrong answer.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Why would they do that?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>Because the majority of people taking part in the experiment had been told to give the wrong answer. Let's hear Professor Nick Chater's explanation. He works at the Warwick Business School here in the UK.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>INSERT<br/>Nick Chater, Professor at Warwick Business School, UK<br/></span></strong><span>By the time it comes to you a whole list of people have said something plainly wrong and you are either going to have to fold and say, 'well, I just agree with them' or you're going to rather uncomfortably say, 'well, I think it's <em>one</em> actually'. And most people, most of the time, tend to fold.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Professor Nick Chater. He uses the word <strong>fold</strong>, which means you give up. But, Sophie, if people are uncomfortable about supporting the wrong answer, or something they don't believe in, why do they do it?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>Because even though we feel uncomfortable <strong>going along with</strong> \u2013 or agreeing with \u2013 something we don't believe, we're even more uncomfortable about disagreeing with the group.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, I didn't realize that people were such sheep. I have a will of steel, Sophie.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>Is that right? So, your <strong>will of steel</strong> \u2013 or strong determination \u2013 somehow melted away in the staff meeting yesterday, I suppose?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Oh well\u2026 of course\u2026 yes\u2026</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>Let's move on and consider briefly how social media encourages groupthink. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, there's a real danger with something like, for example, the Twitter \u2013 the social networking service. Because when an opinion on Twitter starts to \u201ctrend\u201d, it can take on a momentum of its own, and people adopt it simply because it's popular, not because they really believe it.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>And <strong>momentum</strong> means a force that keeps something going once it has started. Let's hear from journalist and author, Jon Ronson. He has an interesting opinion about this.</span></p>, <p><span><strong>INSERT<br/>Jon Ronson, journalist and author</strong> <br/></span><span>One of the ironies here is that on social media we all like to see ourselves as nonconformists but when we all get together in a group what we're doing is using our individual nonconformity to create a more conformist world. So if somebody steps out of line, all us nonconformists, in this frightened conformist way, tear them apart. It's like we're defining the boundaries of normality by tearing apart the people on the outside.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>Jon Ronson. Are you a <strong>nonconformist</strong> then, Neil \u2013 someone who thinks and behaves differently from other people?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>I'm not the type that Jon Ronson is describing \u2013 one who joins up with other so-called nonconformists to bully people with different views. Now remember I asked you earlier: In which story by Hans Christian Andersen does a young boy dare to tell the truth when everyone else goes along with an obvious lie? Is it\u2026 a) The Red Shoes, b) The Snow Queen or c) The Emperor's New Clothes?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>I guessed c) The Emperor's New Clothes.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And you were right, Sophie! The Emperor's New Clothes is a story by Hans Christian Andersen about two weavers who promise an emperor a new suit of clothes that is invisible to those who are stupid or incompetent. No one dares to say that he doesn't see any suit of clothes until a child cries out, \u201cBut he isn't wearing anything at all!\u201d</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>It's a great story \u2013 and a lesson to us all. Now can we hear the words we learned today please?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>They are:<br/></span><span>decaffeinated<br/></span><span>groupthink<br/></span><span>contrary to<br/></span><span>conformity<br/></span><span>fold<br/></span><span>going along with<br/></span><span>will of steel<br/></span><span>momentum<br/></span><span>nonconformist</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

And did you know, Sophie, that scientists believe learning a second language can boost brainpower? <strong>Bilingualism</strong> \u2013 or speaking two languages equally well \u2013 is a form of brain training. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span><strong>Brain training</strong> is where you're learning ways to increase your memory or intelligence.

No. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>Well, brain training is the subject of today's show. And ways to train your brain might be doing a crossword puzzle, playing chess, or studying a new language! Now I have a question for you, Neil.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>I hope my brain is up to the challenge. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>I'm sure it is. Can you tell me: How many <strong>neurons</strong> \u2013 or nerve cells \u2013 are there in the typical human brain? Is it \u2026<br/></span><span>a) 8.6 billion<br/></span><span>b) 86 billion<br/></span><span>Or c) 860 billion</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Hmm. I'm going to say a) 8.6 billion. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>Well, we'll find out later on in the show whether you got the answer right or not. But now let's listen to neuropsychologist Dr Catherine Loveday talking about why being bilingual may protect your brain from damage if you have a stroke.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>INSERT<br/>Dr Catherine Loveday, neuropsychologist<br/></span></strong><span>I think the theory behind why bilingualism might be a protective factor is that [it] involves a lot of switchings \u2013 a lot of attentional changes \u2013 lots of switching. And that seems to exercise the sort of executive parts of our brain. Those parts of the brain are kind of stronger and fitter when it comes to resisting some kind of damage from the stroke.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>A <strong>stroke</strong> is a serious illness that occurs when blood flow to an area of the brain is cut off. And <strong>executive functions</strong> are the mental skills involved in doing things like problem solving and planning. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>So when a bilingual speaker <strong>switches </strong>\u2013 or changes \u2013 from one language to another \u2013 this exercises the executive parts of their brain, making it stronger and fitter. And because the brain is stronger, it's able to <strong>resist</strong> \u2013 or prevent \u2013 damage caused by a stroke. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>But many of us aren't bilingual are we? So our brains aren't going to be protected against strokes. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>Don't worry, Neil. There are other things you can do to exercise your brain. If you're right handed, doing tasks like brushing your teeth with your left hand will stimulate your brain \u2013 or getting dressed in the dark with your eyes shut. Or simply memorizing a list of words, for example your shopping list.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Doing things with the wrong hand sounds hard. But the shopping list thing sounds easier\u2026 OK. Let's see\u2026 pizza, doughnuts, crisps, bottle of coke, chocolate cake\u2026</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>That's not a very healthy list, Neil! A good diet is also important in keeping your brain fit and healthy.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Maybe I should cut down on the chocolate cake then?</span></p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Actually, that's one thing you could leave on the list. According to research, chocolate may <strong>enhance</strong> \u2013 or improve \u2013 cognitive performance, and that is your ability to acquire and utilize knowledge. Now let's listen to Dr Loveday talking about building up our <strong>cognitive reserve</strong> \u2013 this is the idea of building up extra abilities to help protect the brain against declining memory or thinking.</p>, <p><strong><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">INSERT<br/>Dr Catherine Loveday, neuropsychologist<br/></span></strong><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">Continually just stimulating the brain \u2013 things like learning a language, learning music, just educating yourself, seems to continue to build up that cognitive reserve. So even if people take up languages or take up other things later in life it will give them a degree of protection.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span><strong>Stimulate</strong> means to make something become more active. Hmm. Not sure I'm continually stimulating my brain. What do you think, Sophie?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>With all our stimulating discussions, Neil, I'm sure we're both building up our cognitive reserve. And there are your Japanese lessons too. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, so I am doing well as far as my cognitive reserve goes. Sophie you've put my mind at rest.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>And if you <strong>put someone's mind at rest</strong> you stop them worrying. Well, don't get too relaxed Neil \u2013 your brain needs constant stimulation, remember?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Hmm. I think I might just lie down after the show with a box of chocolates and today's crossword\u2026 or maybe I'll memorize another shopping list\u2026 this time in Japanese.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>OK. I think it's time to hear the answer to today's quiz question. I asked: How many neurons are there in the typical human brain? Is it \u2026 a) 8.6 billion b) 86 billion or c) 860 billion?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And I said a) 8.6 billion. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>I thought you were feeling clever today, Neil. I'm afraid that's the wrong answer. It's b) 86 billion. But do you know how scientists calculated that number?</span></p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Did they have a guess, Sophie?</p>, <p><strong><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">Sophie<br/></span></strong><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">No, not exactly. Apparently, the easiest way is to count how many neurons there are in one part of the brain and then multiply that for the rest of the brain's volume. </span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, that's a lot of brain cells. OK, can we hear the words we learned today?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>They are:<br/></span><span>bilingualism<br/></span><span>brain training<br/></span><span>neurons<br/></span><span>stroke<br/></span><span>executive functions<br/></span><span>switches<br/></span><span>resist<br/></span><span>enhance<br/></span><span>cognitive reserve<br/></span><span>stimulate<br/></span><span>put someone's mind at rest</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

But I'll guess that it's c) phubbing!</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Well, we'll find out later on in the show whether you got the answer right or not. Now, let's move on and talk about phone etiquette \u2013 <strong>etiquette</strong> means rules of polite behaviour in society or among people in a certain group.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well\u2026 interrupting conversations to check your phone has become a social norm, hasn't it, Sophie?</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong><strong>Social norms</strong> are the rules of behaviour considered acceptable in a group or society. I don't agree, Neil! Let's listen to Professor Sherry Turkle of Massachusetts Institute of Technology talking about social norms amongst students.</p>, <p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Sherry Turkle, American clinical psychologist and professor of the social studies of Science and Technology at Massachusetts Institute of Technology<br/></strong>I interviewed hundreds of college students and what they talked about was what some of them called 'the rule of three'. And what the rule of three is which is that if you go to dinner with friends, you don't want to look down at your phone until you see that three people, let's say you're six at dinner, are looking up in the conversation. So there's a new etiquette where you don't look down unless three people are looking up kind of to keep a little conversation alive.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Professor Sherry Turkle.</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Why don't you try out the rule of three once in a while?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>There are only two of us here, Sophie - do the math! And I'm listening to you\u2026 mmm\u2026 let me just send a text message here on my phone ... hang on\u2026</p>, <p>[pause]</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Neil\u2026 NEIL! I'm not going to carry on with the show unless you pay attention!</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Sorry, Sophie. Actually I was just doing that to wind you up. I wasn't really using my phone\u2026 Sorry.</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>And to <strong>wind someone up</strong> means to say or do something deliberately in order to annoy someone. Well, I do get wound up about people constantly checking their devices. Yesterday, I was in a caf\u00e9 and two girls came in. They sat down and started chatting away \u2013 but not to each other \u2013 they were tapping away at their devices. And there was no face-to-face conversation at all!</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>But you can have moments of connection using your devices, you know?</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>If you have a<strong> connection </strong>with someone you engage emotionally.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Exactly. I was on the train this morning and there were a couple sharing a tablet. They were looking at the screen, and talking about what they saw there. It was very intimate, and they were\u2026 well\u2026 very connected. Let's hear from Ian Sinclair, British poet and filmmaker, talking about a new generation of connected humans.</p>, <p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Iain Sinclair, British writer, poet, and filmmaker<br/></strong>Physiologically we're changing, that almost the neck muscles are tipped over to look down. We're getting a new kind of human being. And I think \u2013 maybe I'm not getting it \u2013 but there is actually a different kind of intimacy emerging in which these instruments are very important.</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>So Iain Sinclair says our <strong>physiology</strong> is changing \u2013 our bodies, our neck muscles are changing \u2013 to make it easier to look down all the time at our devices! But it isn't only muscles that might change as a result of our techie habits \u2013 it's the way we <strong>interact</strong> \u2013 or engage with each other too. Ian Sinclair talks about a different kind of intimacy emerging \u2013 what does he mean, Neil?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Our <strong>intimacy</strong> \u2013 or closeness \u2013 with other people is somehow connected up with our devices.

Or c) phubbing?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I said c) phubbing.</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>You were right, Neil! Well done! It's a combination of' 'phone' and 'snubbing' \u2013 <strong>snub</strong> means to deliberately ignore someone you know. New words formed by putting together parts of existing words are known as blends or portmanteau words. And 'phubbing' is starting to appear in some online dictionaries.

I'm Sophie\u2026</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I'm Neil\u2026 What did you do at the weekend, Sophie?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>I did a spot of gardening.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>So, you are you a keen gardener?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, I am, Neil. And gardening is the subject of today's show! Now why don't we start with a quiz question?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Good idea.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>What percentage of people in the UK said that gardening makes them happier, according to a survey conducted by the Royal Horticultural Society? Is it\u2026<br/></span><span>a) 22%<br/></span><span>b) 52%<br/></span><span>Or c) 82%?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, I'll guess: b) 52%.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>Well, we'll find out later on if you got it right or not. So, does gardening make you happy, Neil?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, I tried to grow some tomatoes once. And to be honest it made me rather anxious. All the leaves curled up\u2026 and then dropped off. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>Did you get any tomatoes? </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>No.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>So you don't have green fingers, then? Why are you looking at your fingers, Neil? I wasn't asking whether you literally have green fingers! Having <strong>green fingers</strong> means a natural ability for growing plants. It's funny you should say gardening makes you anxious because other people find it calming and relaxing. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Do they? Do you?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, I do. Being in the fresh air, in all weathers, communing with nature\u2026</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Sounds very unpleasant!</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span><strong>In all weathers</strong> means something you do in all types of weather \u2013 rain, snow, sunshine. And <strong>communing with nature</strong> means feeling close to nature, and being a part of it.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, when I tried communing with nature my hands got all scratched \u2013 I got stung by nasty creepy-crawlies \u2013 and I got soil up my nose. I didn't enjoy it at all.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>Try wearing protective clothing next time \u2013 and maybe a nose plug too! A <strong>creepy-crawly</strong> is a small insect, by the way.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>So do you like getting your hands dirty, Sophie?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, I love it. And it turns out there might be a good reason for this. Dr Christopher Lowry from the University of Colorado conducted an experiment to test whether soil gives us a <strong>natural high</strong> \u2013 meaning to make us happy without taking drugs. He injected a bacterium commonly found in soil into mice to see what effect this would have on them. Let's hear what he said in this BBC programme.</span></p>, <p><span><strong>INSERT<br/>Dr Christopher Lowry, neuroscientist,</strong> <strong>University of Colorado US and Helena Merriman, presenter<br/></strong></span><span><strong>CL:</strong> Rodents like mice and rats are very good swimmers and it was found many years ago that if you treat animals with antidepressant drugs and then put the animals in just a beaker of water it would cause the animals to swim for longer periods of time.<br/></span><span><strong>HM:</strong> After injecting the mice with the bacterium Dr Lowry placed them in a cup of water.<br/></span><span><strong>CL:</strong> These mice that had been injected with bacterium swam during a 6-minute test for a longer period of time than animals that just got a placebo.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>So the bacterium had a similar effect on the mice as an antidepressant drug might. When we dig in soil we <strong>ingest</strong> \u2013 or absorb \u2013 the bacterium through our lungs or cuts in our skin. A <strong>placebo</strong>, by the way, is a substance with no physical effects that is used when testing a drug. So here one group of mice were injected with the bacterium and another group were injected with the placebo. And since the mice seemed happier when treated with soil bacteria, there's a good chance we would too.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Let's move on and hear about how gardening can be <strong>therapeutic</strong> \u2013 or used to try and treat addiction. Here's Scot Stephenson, a recovering alcoholic, who is learning to garden to help cure him.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>INSERT<br/>Scot Stephenson, recovering alcoholic<br/></span></strong><span>I left school early or should I say I got expelled... came here, I got my NVQ level 2 which is my first qualification and enjoyed it ever since.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>So Scot Stephenson was <strong>expelled</strong> from school \u2013 he was forced to leave \u2013 with no qualifications. But with the help of a support group he now has an<strong> NVQ</strong> \u2013 that's a National Vocational Qualification here in Britain \u2013 in gardening.\u00a0 </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>That's right. At a centre in the UK, recovering alcoholics have been given the opportunity to plant, grow, and even sell their produce. These addicts are literally breaking their addiction by breaking the soil.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Nicely phrased, Sophie!</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>Thank you! Now, are you ready, Neil, for the answer to today's quiz question? </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>I am.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>I asked: What percentage of people in the UK said that gardening makes them happier, according to a survey conducted by the Royal Horticultural Society? Is it\u2026 a) 22%, b) 52% or c) 82%?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>I guessed b) 52%. I'm wrong, aren't I?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>Oh, you are Neil, I'm sorry. The percentage of people who really enjoy gardening is much higher. You should have chosen option c). A survey from the Royal Horticultural Society has shown that Brits truly are a nation of gardeners with 82% saying it makes them feel happier. The results also revealed that 70% said that given the choice, they would prefer to spend their working day in the garden with just 9% opting for an office and 21% undecided.</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, I'm with the 9% I'm afraid. Now can we hear the words we learned today, Sophie?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>They are:<br/></span><span>green fingers<br/></span><span>in all weathers<br/></span><span>communing with nature<br/></span><span>creepy-crawly<br/></span><span>natural high<br/></span><span>ingest<br/></span><span>placebo<br/></span><span>therapeutic<br/></span><span>expelled<br/></span><span>NVQ</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

I'm Sophie\u2026</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I'm Neil. So, Sophie I watched Snow White and the Huntsma</span><span>n on TV last night.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>Oh, you mean the modern retelling of the story Snow White<em>?</em> Did you enjoy it, Neil?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>It was OK. But the seven dwarves were no fun. I prefer the original Disney cartoon version.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>Don't be silly, Neil. Walt Disney didn't invent the story. The movie you watched is a <strong>remake</strong>, a film that has been made again, but the fairy tale is very old.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, that may be true, but I still prefer the Disney version with funny dwarves. In the new version, even the names of the dwarves are different and, you know, serious looking.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>But this new version is for young adults \u2013 it's a different <strong>genre</strong> \u2013 or style \u2013 of film. Names like Sneezy, Dopey, Happy and Grumpy are too childish. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Hmm. What's wrong with childish?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>It's right up your street, isn't it Neil?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Too right. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>Anyway, fairy tales are the subject of today's show, and I have a question for you: which movie star played the role of the evil fairy in Maleficent, a 2014 film based on the fairy tale Sleeping Beauty? Was it\u2026<br/></span><span>a) Cate Blanchett?<br/></span><span>b) Angelina Jolie?<br/></span><span>Or c) Meryl Streep?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, I'll go for a) Cate Blanchett. She often plays evil characters. I can't forget her in the 2008 movie Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>Well, we'll find out if you chose the right move star later on in the programme. But to return to the idea of childish fairy stories, let's listen to Diane Purkiss, a children's author, talking about how originally fairy tales were intended for an adult audience.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>INSERT<br/>Diane Purkiss, children's author<br/></span></strong><span>Interestingly there has been a bit of a move towards seeing fairy tales as an adult, or at any rate a young adult \u2013 a dark sort of genre. And that's natural because actually in the past fairy tales were told by adults to adults in William Shakespeare's time. It's only in the Victorian era that they become moral children's tales and it looks like we're going back to the inception of fairy stories now with a more adult take on them.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Diane Purkiss. So these Hollywood remakes aimed at the teen market are actually returning fairy tales to an adult audience. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>That's right, Neil. And <strong>dark</strong> here means scary or frightening. The Victorians <strong>toned down</strong> this dark content \u2013 or made it less forceful. They also introduced a <strong>moral</strong> \u2013 or message about what's right and wrong \u2013 to the tales.\u00a0 </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And <strong>inception</strong> means the beginning. So fairy tales began as a dark genre.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>Can you give us some examples of dark stories written by the brothers Grimm, Neil?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well\u2026 I have a list here. Let's see. In The Frog Prince the princess doesn't kiss the frog, she throws it\u2026 she throws it against the wall! Hmm, yes.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>Hmm. I prefer the kiss version.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And in Little Red Riding Hood don't believe that version where the wolf shuts granny in a cupboard. In the real version he gobbles her up and then eats Red Riding Hood for dessert.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>Charming. And to <strong>gobble something up</strong> means to eat it very fast. OK, that's enough. Let's move on. Did you know that some of the stories \u2013 like Beauty and the Beast, Red Riding Hood, Cinderella, and Snow White go back much further than the earliest written stories \u2013 even the ones in Latin and Greek?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>No, I didn't. To be honest, Sophie, I thought Walt Disney had written them.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>Oh Neil\u2026 well research suggests that some fairy tales date back to well before the brothers Grimm and even Shakespeare. Let's hear more from Dr Jamie Tehrani, anthropologist at Durham University in the UK.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>INSERT<br/>Dr Jamie Tehrani, anthropologist at Durham University<br/></span></strong><span><strong>Dr JTehrani:</strong> So these fairy tales that we've looked at \u2013 we've been able to trace back, really,\u00a0thousands of years \u2013 probably sort of 4-6,000 years is the origin of many famous European folk tales, stories such as Beauty and the Beast.<br/></span><span><strong>BBC Reporter:</strong> What, 6,000 years?!<br/></span><span><strong>Dr J Tehrani:</strong> Yep, going right back to the Bronze Age. <br/></span><span><strong>BBC Reporter:</strong> Good heavens!<br/><strong>Dr J Tehrani:</strong> We've been able to trace the transmission across generations of these stories much further back than is generally recognized.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>But Sophie \u2013 if there's no written evidence of the stories from 6,000 years ago how does Dr Tehrani, who we've just heard from, know people were telling them?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>Well, dating languages isn't something I'm familiar with \u2013 I think it's a bit like looking at a few dinosaur bones and trying to reconstruct what dinosaurs looked like. But here you're trying to reconstruct stories without any actual bits. It must have been hard work for the researchers. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Indeed. Well, I think it's time to hear the quiz question again, Sophie.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>OK, I asked: Which movie star played the role of the evil fairy in Maleficent, a film based on the fairy tale Sleeping Beauty? Was it\u2026 a) Cate Blanchett? b) Angelina Jolie? Or c) Meryl Streep?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>I said Cate Blanchett.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>And you were wrong. Angelina Jolie played the main character in the film Maleficent. Cate Blanchett played the elf queen Galadriel in Lord of the Rings. And Meryl Streep played a blue-haired witch in the 2014 film Into the Woods.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Now, can we hear those words again?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>OK!<br/></span><span>remake<br/></span><span>genre <br/></span><span>dark<br/></span><span>toned down<br/></span><span>moral<br/></span><span>inception<br/></span><span>gobble up</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, that's the end of today's spellbinding 6 Minute English.

I was hoping for some tips on how to work more effectively with my co-presenter.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>I think we work very effectively already, Neil. Now, today's show is about <strong>team building</strong> \u2013 or encouraging employees to work well together as a team by getting them to engage in different types of activities.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And apparently, some companies in the UK are offering their employees activities such as\u2026 \u00a0Hunger Games-style combat days where teams must work together to 'kill' as many of the opposing team as possible. Have you seen the Hunger Games movies, Sophie? </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>Yes.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>There're also Zombie boot camps where military instructors train you on how to fight zombies \u2013 that's dead people who have come back to life. For the more <strong>cerebral</strong> \u2013 or brainy \u2013 amongst us \u2013 there are crime investigations modelled on popular TV dramas like Sherlock Holmes.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>Well, I'm not sure about the Zombie boot camp \u2013 a <strong>boot camp</strong> is a short course of hard physical training \u2013 but the Sherlock Holmes awayday sounds like fun.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>I'd definitely go for the Zombie experience. Though I'm not sure how it connects with most people's working lives. Violence, death, the living dead\u2026</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>Good point.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>So let's move on and have today's quiz question. What did Chairman Mao introduce in China in1951 as a compulsory activity for workers and was reintroduced by the government a few years ago?

Well, we'll find out later if you're right or not. Now, whilst English lessons might sound like hard work, <em>ukulele</em> lessons are apparently catching on. A ukulele is a musical instrument. Top businessmen Bill Gates and Warren Buffett both do it, and stressed-out city workers are following their lead. Here in the UK, a number of companies have been holding ukulele team building sessions. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>That sounds amazing. And is there anything about the ukulele in particular that leaves people feeling better after they've played it?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Let's hear more about this from Lorraine Bow, who teaches people to play the instrument. But listen with attention because she spoke on the phone and the line wasn't great.</span></p>, <p><span><strong>INSERT<br/>Lorraine Bow, ukulele teacher <br/></strong></span><span>Well, I guess it's just the fact that you know people don't often sing in their everyday lives and it's the fact that you can play and sing \u2013 play a musical instrument \u2013 within an hour \u2013 it's quite a\u2026 you know\u2026 it's quite a fulfilling thing really. It's not competitive \u2013 it's quite easy to do and a bit less intimidating than a guitar\u2026</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>Lorraine, the ukulele teacher, also says her classes aren't competitive or <strong>intimidating</strong>\u2026 </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>\u2026 which means something that makes you feel nervous. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>Now, before we hear the answer to today's quiz question, let's hear about a company in Abu Dhabi where leadership is taught through horse training. Basically, you have to go in the yard with a horse and persuade it that you're the boss by using body language. Here's Kelly Eide, co-founder of the company, explaining why she thinks this approach works.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>INSERT<br/>Kelly Eide, Co-founder of True Leadership, Abu Dhabi<br/></span></strong><span>The horses don't care if your hair is purple, if you're a man or a woman, if you're old or young, if you are\u2026 what religion. So it transcends all of those cultural boundaries \u2013 it transcends age, gender, religion, tradition etc. \u2013 so that's a perfect fit. And in an organization where you really need groups of people to gel, who come from backgrounds which have no common norms, you can teach that most efficiently with a horse.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil <br/></span></strong><span>To <strong>gel</strong> with someone means to connect or get on well with someone. So you try and get the horse to do what you want using body language. And the horse feels instinctively whether or not you are a natural leader because it doesn't recognize cultural differences, hair colour and age. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>Probably easier said than done.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Indeed. Now remember I asked: What did Chairman Mao introduce in China in1951 as a compulsory activity for workers and was reintroduced by the government a few years ago?\u00a0 Was it\u2026 a) calisthenics? b) calligraphy? Or c) English language lessons? </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>I said a) calisthenics.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, you're right on the button! Well done there, Sophie! Calisthenics are used at schools as a warm up for physical education classes, during sports day activities, and by some companies as a way of building morale and a sense of group unity, as well as to raise energy levels and encourage good health. Now <strong>shake a leg</strong> \u2013 or in other words \u2013 get moving \u2013 and tell us the words we learned today, Sophie.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>They are:<br/></span><span>awayday<br/></span><span>guru<br/></span><span>team building<br/></span><span>cerebral<br/></span><span>bootcamp<br/></span><span>callisthenics<br/></span><span>calligraphy<br/></span><span>synchronise<br/></span><span>intimidating<br/></span><span>gel<br/></span><span>shake a leg</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, that's the end of this 6 Minute English.

I'm Sophie\u2026</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I'm Neil. Sophie \u2013 did you see the beautiful sky last night?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>No, I went to bed early. Why?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>I was wondering if there was life out there.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>You mean life on other planets? That's just science fiction, Neil. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>It isn't! People are fascinated by life on other planets for a good reason.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>You believe in little green men?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Not necessarily\u2026 but possibly.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>Well, Mars is our closest neighbour in the solar system and the subject of today's show. And that brings me on to our usual quiz question. How long is a day on Mars? Is it about\u2026<br/></span><span>a) 5 hours?<br/></span><span>b) 25 hours?<br/></span><span>Or c) 45 hours?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And I think it must be c) 45 hours. Things are weird on other planets. And Mars is further from the sun than us\u2026 Mars may be our closest neighbour, but it's hardly in our backyard, is it?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>It is in astronomical terms, Neil \u2013 it's visible to <strong>the naked eye</strong> \u2013 meaning without using instruments \u2013 and it's reachable by spacecraft. Well, we\u2019ll find out later on in the show whether you got the answer right or not. Now can you tell me Neil why people like you get excited about the possibility of life on Mars? </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, Mars is similar to the Earth in some important ways which means if life developed on our planet, why not Mars?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>That's true. Its temperature is in the right zone \u2013 not too hot and not too cold. But actually we could find Mars pretty cold \u2013 an average temperature would be around minus 63 degrees Celsius compared to Earth's 14 degrees Celsius. It's also very <strong>arid</strong> \u2013 or dry. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And it needs to be wet for life to develop, doesn't it?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>That's right. Many scientists think that liquid water is essential for life! But there may have been water on the surface of Mars in the past. And recent research suggests that there may be water underground. Let's hear some more about this from Professor John Zarnecki, who teaches Space Science at The Open University. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>INSERT<br/>John Zarnecki, Professor of Space Science, The Open University<br/></span></strong><span>We are now seeing that in fact Mars probably does have water \u2013 not liquid water \u2013 that there is ice just below the surface and there's even just recently tantalizing evidence that perhaps water does flow periodically... Now, and also coupled with the fact that here on Earth we're finding that life in very primitive form exists in the most extreme environments, these are the so called 'extremophiles' that exist at the bottom of the oceans\u2026 So life is much, much tougher.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>What does <strong>tantalizing</strong> mean, Sophie?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>It means something you want that's almost, but not quite, within reach. So, scientists would love to think water flows on Mars but the evidence isn't strong enough for this to be certain. The other interesting point the professor makes is that life may exist in the very harsh Martian environment \u2013 because primitive life exists in extreme places on Earth.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/>E</span></strong><span><strong>xtremophiles</strong> are <strong>organisms</strong> \u2013 or small creatures \u2013 that live in very extreme environments and can survive conditions that would kill most other organisms. But on Mars they would be living underground because the <strong>radiation</strong> \u2013 or light and heat \u2013 from the Sun would kill any organisms living on the surface of the planet. So why doesn\u2019t the Sun's radiation kill us then, Sophie?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>The Earth has a strong magnetic field created by its hot molten <strong>core</strong> \u2013 or centre \u2013 and this protects us from the Sun's harmful solar winds. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And what about Mars - why doesn't it have a magnetic field?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>It used to \u2013 4 billion years ago. It\u2019s possible that a massive <strong>collision</strong> with an asteroid might have heated up Mars's core, disrupting the magnetic fields.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And if you <strong>disrupt</strong> a process you stop it from continuing normally. Now, to return to the subject of collisions, Sophie, I have something very interesting to tell you.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>Yes?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>A <strong>meteorite</strong> \u2013 or a piece of rock from outer space \u2013 might've crashed into the Earth millions of years ago. That meteorite might have contained Martian life forms. So we might be descended from Martians! </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>That's actually an interesting idea, Neil. But let's listen to Professor John Zarnecki talking about interplanetary life.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>INSERT<br/>John Zarnecki, Professor of Space Science, The Open University<br/></span></strong><span>If we do find traces of life on Mars we don't know, do we - whether it evolved independently or was it perhaps seeded from Earth. It is possible that life forms from Earth travelled to Mars and perhaps existed there \u2013 or the other way round. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>So life on Mars may have <strong>evolved</strong> \u2013 or developed \u2013 on its own. Or it might have arrived from Earth in a lump of rock\u2026 Or the other way round! So Martians might be humans or we might be Martians! One big interplanetary happy family, Sophie!</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Well Neil, let's hope you stay happy after you hear the answer to today's quiz question. I asked: How long is a day on Mars? Is it \u2026 a) 5 hours? b) 25 hours? Or c) 45 hours?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And I said c) 45 hours \u2013 they must have a long day over there.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>And you were \u2026 wrong! The correct answer is b) because a day on Mars is slightly longer than here on Earth \u2013 it's 25 hours. </span><span>Anyway, can we at least hear the words we learned today?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>They are:<br/></span><span>the naked eye<br/></span><span>arid<br/></span><span>tantalizing<br/></span><span>extremophiles<br/></span><span>organisms<br/></span><span>radiation<br/></span><span>core<br/></span><span>disrupt<br/></span><span>meteorite<br/></span><span>evolved</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

I'm Sophie\u2026</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I'm Neil. I was watching the news the other day, Sophie.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>Learn anything interesting?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, actually. UK scientists have been authorised by the government to genetically modify human embryos for research. What they can't do though is implant modified embryos into women.

And in case you didn't know, <strong>DNA</strong> is short for deoxyribonucleic acid \u2013 this is a substance in the cells of animals and plants that contains genetic information. And a <strong>gene</strong> is part of the DNA in\u00a0the cell that controls the physical development and behaviour of a plant or animal and is passed on from its parents.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Phew! Thanks for the science lesson, Sophie. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>You're welcome. Now here's a question for you, Neil: Which science fiction film anticipates gene editing in a dystopian society where humans are genetically engineered? Is it\u2026<br/></span><span>a) Robocop<br/></span><span>b) Gattaca<br/></span><span>or c) Blade Runner</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Mmm\u2026 I don't really understand the question but I'm going to say c) Blade Runner. What's dystopian?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span><strong>Dystopian</strong> means an imaginary society where people are unhappy and afraid. Well, moving on, let's listen to BBC journalist Fergus Walsh talking about how gene editing works.</span></p>, <p><span><strong>INSERT<br/>Fergus Walsh, BBC journalist<br/></strong></span><span>Think of gene editing as a molecular sat nav. It scans the DNA searching for the error. Then it uses molecular scissors to snip through both strands, which switches off the faulty gene. Or it can repair the code by inserting a healthy copy of the gene. These techniques raise the prospect of treating \u2013 even curing \u2013 some genetic diseases \u2013 and it's not science fiction.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>So DNA is a set of instructions for how our bodies work written using a chemical code of four letters \u2013 A, T, C, G. But sometimes the code contains mistakes. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yes. You find spelling mistakes by <strong>scanning</strong> \u2013 or searching \u2013 through the DNA. Then you <strong>snip</strong> \u2013 or cut out \u2013 the mistake or faulty gene from the code using molecular scissors. <strong>Faulty</strong> by the way, means something that isn't working properly \u2013 like the faulty brakes on my bike.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>That sounds really dangerous, Neil!</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yeah, but I'm more worried about my faulty genes. I might have all sorts of genetic mistakes inside me.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>That wouldn't surprise me. But you've actually touched on a serious point. Latest research suggests all our bodies do contain genetic mistakes, some of which could cause disease. And as reporter Fergus Walsh said at the end of the clip, gene editing could be important for treating or even curing inherited genetic diseases. For patients with blood, immune, muscle or skin disorders it offers the possibility that their faulty cells could be removed, or changed in the lab, and then put back. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>That sounds amazing. But is there a <strong>catch</strong>?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>And that means a problem or drawback. Yes. Some people think that if editing the genes of a human embryo is allowed for curing disease, this will lead to editing the genes of embryos for reasons other than health. Let's listen to Marcy Darnovsky, executive director of the Centre for Genetics and Society in California talking about her concerns.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>INSERT<br/>Marcy Darnovsky, Centre for Genetics and Society<br/></span></strong><span>It's too risky, we don't need it, there are other ways to have healthy children, and it would open the door \u2013 possibly \u2013 to a world of genetic haves and have nots. We don't need more inequality, we don't need more discrimination in the world. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>An <strong>embryo</strong> by the way is an animal or human starting to develop inside its mother. Marcy Darnovsky is against gene editing because it may be used to create <strong>designer babies</strong> \u2013 or babies whose genes have been selected to have certain desirable characteristics.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>She says it may <strong>open the door </strong>\u2013 or make it possible \u2013 a situation where embryos are genetically <strong>enhanced</strong> \u2013 or improved \u2013 to be more intelligent or physically stronger, for example.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And this will lead to more <strong>discrimination</strong> in the world \u2013 which means treating some people less fairly than others\u2026 </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>\u2026which is something that science fiction has been predicting for many years. It's that dystopian society we were discussing earlier, Neil! Which science fiction film anticipates gene editing in a dystopian society where humans are genetically engineered? Is it\u2026 a) Robocop b) Gattaca or c) Blade Runner?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And I said c) Blade Runner.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>Sorry, Neil! It was b) Gattaca. This 1997 sci-fi film centres on the character Vincent Freeman, who wasn't genetically engineered, but is able to buy the genetic identity of another man in order to pursue his dream of travelling into space. The film's title uses the letters G, A, T and C, which are the four chemical codes making up DNA.<br/></span><span>Now here are today's words: <br/></span><span>gene editing<br/></span><span>manipulate<br/></span><span>DNA<br/></span><span>gene<br/></span><span>dystopian<br/></span><span>scanning<br/></span><span>snip<br/></span><span>faulty<br/></span><span>catch<br/></span><span>embryo<br/></span><span>designer babies<br/></span><span>open the door<br/></span><span>enhanced<br/></span><span>discrimination</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

I'm Neil\u2026</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>And I'm Sophie\u2026\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>Sophie, I can't get out of my head what Mark Zuckerberg, you know, the guy who created Facebook, said recently.</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Oh, I know, he <strong>pledged</strong> \u2013 or made a serious promise \u2013 to give away 99% of his shares in Facebook over the course of his lifetime. The shares are currently worth around $45bn.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Why, oh why did he decide to give his fortune away? It's puzzling to me.</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>It's an act of <strong>philanthropy</strong> \u2013 which means helping others, especially by giving large amounts of money to good causes.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And philanthropy is the subject of this show.</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>But don't worry about Zuckerberg, it's probably fair to say that he will remain extremely <strong>well off</strong> \u2013 or wealthy \u2013 even after giving away his fortune.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, that's true. Let me ask you then today's quiz question: Who was the most generous philanthropist in the US last year? Was it\u2026<br/>a) Bill Gates<br/>b) Mark Zuckerberg<br/>Or c) Warren Buffett</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>I'm going to say\u2026 c) Warren Buffett.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, we'll find out if you were right or not later on in the show. Now, Zuckerberg was inspired to give away his fortune by the birth of his daughter Max. In a letter to Max \u2013 posted on Facebook. In his post, he talks about using the money to advance <strong>human potential </strong>and promote <strong>equality</strong> for all children in the next generation. Equality \u2013 in other words, with the same rights and opportunities.</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Zuckerberg is the latest in a long line of billionaire entrepreneurs to turn philanthropist and use his money for good causes. Did you know that some of the earliest American philanthropists were robber barons?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Robber barons? What's \u2026 ? Hang on, what're robber barons?</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>They're business people who use <strong>unethical -</strong> or morally wrong - business tactics to gain large personal fortunes. Nineteenth-century entrepreneurs like Rockefeller, Carnegie and Ford were robber barons. They built up huge empires in industry \u2013 oil, steel, railways, and cars \u2013 and were largely responsible for transforming the United States from an agricultural nation into an industrial one.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Henry Ford \u2013 he's the one who said you can have any colour you want as long as it's black. I like that kind of thing.</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Focus, Neil!</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>OK. OK.</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>But as the barons got older, they decided they wanted to give back to society, and turned to philanthropy. Andrew Carnegie believed that wealth should be spent to make the world a better place.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>That sounds too warm and fuzzy for a <strong>ruthless</strong> \u2013 or cruel - robber baron.</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>People change, Neil! When he died, Carnegie had given away a total of $350m to the state to spend on public works. That's around $8bn in today's money.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, let's listen to Hugh Cunningham, a Professor of History at the University of Kent here, in the UK. He talks about what the <strong>average Joe</strong> \u2013 that's you and me, folks \u2013 thinks about big business and philanthropy today.</p>, <p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Hugh Cunningham, Emeritus Professor of History at the University of Kent<br/></strong>The very word philanthropy does not necessarily have 100% positive connotations for the public at large given where we are in terms of the public's attitude towards business or the banks and that kind of stuff. So I think it's in everyone's interests to try and broaden out the concept of philanthropy into a wider notion of giving, making a contribution, making a difference.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, banks and big businesses can easily afford to give away millions of dollars for the public good if they choose to. It is not so easy when you're an individual struggling to pay the rent.</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>That's right, Neil. But a lot of people in the UK are super-rich compared to those in the developing world. And we can make a big difference by <strong>donating</strong> \u2013 or giving \u2013 smaller amounts of money to help improve their lives.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And that's what Professor Cunningham means when he says we should broaden out the <strong>notion</strong> \u2013 or idea \u2013 of philanthropy. It's not only robber barons who can afford to be philanthropic. Let's listen to Toby Ord, a graduate student from Oxford University talking about how he makes a difference.</p>, <p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Toby Ord, moral philosopher, Oxford University<br/></strong>I worked out that over my life I'd be able to earn about \u00a31.5m and that I could maintain my current standard of living as a graduate student and still donate about \u00a31m of that.</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>So Toby actually gives away any money that he earns above \u00a318,000 a year. He feels that he doesn't need more than this amount to maintain his standard of living.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I'm impressed by Toby's pledge but I don't think I could live like a student my whole life!</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>I thought that would suit you extremely well, Neil! Now why don't you give us the answer to today's quiz question?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I asked: Who was the most generous philanthropist in the US last year? Was it\u2026 a) Bill Gates? b) Mark Zuckerberg? Or c) Warren Buffett?</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>I said Warren Buffett.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Good guess, Sophie! Well done! Buffett, who made his $73bn fortune from investments, donated $2.8bn to charity in 2014 bringing his lifetime total to almost $23bn, according to Forbes. That's <strong>a tidy sum</strong> \u2013 and that means a large number! OK let's hear those words again, Sophie.</p>, <p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Here they are:<br/>pledged<br/>philanthropy<br/>well off<br/>human potential<br/>equality<br/>unethical<br/>ruthless<br/>average Joe<br/>donating<br/>a tidy sum</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

I'm Alice\u2026</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>\u2026 and I'm Neil. Alice, have you got two pounds? I forgot my wallet and I need a coffee. I've only got these pennies.</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Sorry \u2013 I always use my bankcard in the cafeteria. </span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>You use a card to buy coffee?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Yes. It's a tap-and-go card so it's quick \u2013 you don't enter a PIN number \u2013 and everyone in the coffee queue uses them\u2026 except you. And today's show is about how we pay for things.</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, I pay for things with money! </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>There are different kinds of money. You're behind the curve, digging around in your pockets for change, Neil. Do you still use cheques too?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, I do. Cheques are very useful. Now, being <strong>behind the curve</strong> means not keeping up with current trends. So help me keep up, Alice. What's a tap-and-go card? I thought you were talking about your regular bankcard.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Well,<strong> tap-and-go </strong>cards are regular bankcards but with a built-in chip and antenna. The card reader sends out a radio frequency and when you bring the card close to the reader, the antenna picks up the signal to make the payment.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Hmm. This antenna business doesn't sound secure \u2013 an <strong>antenna</strong> is used for sending or receiving radio signals. Doesn't it mean your personal data is flying around in the ether for anyone to steal?</span><strong><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">Alice</span></strong></p>, <p><span>In this context, <strong>ether</strong> means the air where electronic communication happens. And nothing's flying around, Peter Pan! At less than half a second per transaction, there's no time for anyone to steal your cash! Now, why don't you answer today's quiz question? Which man's face appears on a UK ten pound note? Is it\u2026<br/></span><span>a)\u00a0\u00a0 Charles Darwin<br/></span><span>b)\u00a0\u00a0 Isaac Newton<br/></span><span>or c)\u00a0\u00a0 Albert Einstein<br/><br/></span><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>None of them \u2013 it's the Queen.<br/><br/></span><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>No, Neil. The Queen is on one side, but on the other side of each note is an important historical figure.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Oh really? I've never noticed\u2026 OK, I'll go for b) Isaac Newton. He's a historical figure.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>So are Darwin and Einstein. And coins and banknotes will be historical soon. But we'll find out if you're right later on. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>I'm still concerned about tap-and-go. What if someone steals my card?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Each contactless payment is limited to a certain amount \u2013 the UK's limit is \u00a330. After you've used your card a few times in a row, you have to enter your PIN. And if a thief does go on a spending spree with your card, your bank covers you against fraud. Whereas, if someone steals your banknotes, that's your bad luck!</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>OK, good points. <strong>Fraud</strong> means getting money by cheating people. And a <strong>spending spree</strong> is a short period of time where you do a lot of shopping. Are you a big spender, Alice?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Not with my tap-and-go, Neil. How about you and your chequebook?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>No comment. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Moving on. If getting your bankcard out seems like too much trouble there's now a solution with <strong>wearable tech</strong> \u2013 that's clothing and accessories that include computer and electronic technologies. Let's hear what Kenneth Cukier, a technology expert, has to say.</span></p>, <p><span><strong>INSERT<br/>Kenneth Cukier, economist and technology expert<br/></strong></span><span>You can simply take any wireless card and the chip from it that your bank might issue you with, and you can put it into the coat and then when you want to make a payment you just simply wave your arm in front of the terminal and leave with your latte. This is intended for people who are incredibly lazy who don't want to take their card out of their wallet, or use their phone, or use their watch. People are going to be making more purchases more of the time \u2013 particularly for small-valued goods.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>What Kenneth Cukier said is very interesting. That sounds tempting but I'm still concerned about how safe this all is. What if I wave my arm around and make a payment by mistake?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>The chip has to get very close to the card reader to make a payment so that's not likely to happen. Now companies are creating new biometric technology \u2013 which you might like Neil \u2013 because it combines payment and security technology. Let's hear more from the BBC reporter Kate Russell.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>INSERT<br/></span></strong><strong><span>Kate Russell, BBC reporter</span></strong><br/><span>For those times when not even carrying a phone is convenient \u2013 at the beach or a festival for example \u2013 the fingo-pay system reads the unique maps of veins under the surface of your finger. The trick is remembering which finger you registered with.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>This high-tech stuff reporter Kate Russell is talking about is amazing! Some day soon we won't have to carry a wallet or a purse or anything. The veins in our finger will <strong>authenticate</strong> payments \u2013 and prove the payments are ours. I can't wait!</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Hmm. Sounds a bit too sci-fi for my liking. How about giving us the answer to today's quiz question?</span></p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Alright then. I asked: Which man's face appears on a UK ten pound note? Is it\u2026 a) Charles Darwin b)\u00a0 Isaac Newton or c)\u00a0 Albert Einstein</p>, <p><strong><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">Neil<br/></span></strong><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">And I said b) Isaac Newton.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Yes. And you were wrong, Neil! It was that other famous person, a) Charles Darwin. Isaac Newton was on the old one pound note which is no longer used. And Einstein was German, not British, so he wouldn't appear on a UK banknote anyway.</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well they look similar, I think.

Would you like some?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Oh, I can't drink that! You didn\u2019t let the tea brew for long enough. And you forgot to add sugar.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Well, make it yourself next time! And when you <strong>brew</strong> a cup of tea, by the way, you add boiling water to tea leaves or a teabag and allow the flavour to develop. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>I'm sorry, Alice. I didn\u2019t mean to be rude about your tea. But I do like it very strong and sweet.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Tea is the subject of today's show. And Neil, I think you'd like the way they serve tea in India. They drink <em>chai </em>\u2013 a strong black tea served with lots of milk, sugar and spices. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Mmm\u2026 that does sound good. I quite fancy a cup of <em>chai</em> now. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Did you know that it was the British who introduced tea to India?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>No, I didn't, Alice. This is very interesting\u2026 I'm proud of our habit of having tea all the time and teabags are great! A marvellous little invention!</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, I agree. Well, that's my question for you today. Where was the teabag invented? Was it in \u2026<br/></span><span>a) China<br/></span><span>b) the US<br/></span><span>Or c) Britain</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Hmm. I buy a lot of teabags but I don't know their history. So I'm going to guess c) Britain. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Well, we'll find out if you chose the right answer later on. Let's listen now to Professor Markman Ellis talking about the Chinese tea plant. He's a historian at Queen Mary, University of London.</span></p>, <p><span><strong>INSERT<br/>Professor Markman Ellis, historian, Queen Mary, University of London<br/></strong></span><span>Tea is a shrub that grows naturally in the mountainous areas of China and several thousand years ago, no one knows how exactly, there\u2026 I mean\u2026 there are stories\u2026 it became clear that if you consumed the leaves of this plant especially the younger leaves, then it had an interesting effect on you. And that effect could be thought of as medicinal or it could be thought of as just kind of sanative \u2013 making you feel a bit better than you used to feel. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Professor Markman Ellis tells us that people in Ancient China <strong>consumed</strong> \u2013 or ate \u2013 leaves from the tea plant and it had an interesting effect on them. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Professor Ellis says tea has a <strong>sanative</strong> effect \u2013 making you feel better \u2013 so I might try munching a few leaves later on.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Alright then. Apparently the Chinese started drinking tea because of its <strong>medicinal</strong> \u2013 or healing \u2013 qualities. And they've been drinking tea for thousands of years! Well we British may love a good cup of tea \u2013 but we haven\u2019t been brewing it for nearly so long as the Chinese.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>But remember that tea actually grows in China, Alice. We don't grow it in Britain.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Good point, Neil. Which brings me back to what we were talking about earlier. In the 19th c</span><span>entury the British started to grow tea in India in order to compete with Chinese tea production. When tea first arrived in Britain in the 17th c</span><span>entury it was incredibly expensive and only the elite could afford to drink it.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span><strong>Elite</strong> means a small group of people in society who have money and power. Well, the opposite is true today \u2013 everyone drinks tea! And cheap teabags make really strong tea \u2013 just the way I like it!</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>[noise of disgust] Oh, it's not for me! I like tea with a delicate flavour \u2013 Lapsang Suchong is my favourite with its evocative fragrance.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Not teabags, then? </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>No, Neil. Lapsang is different from other types of tea because the leaves are smoke-dried over pinewood fires giving the tea its distinctive smoky flavour.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>You sound like a TV advert \u2013 I can just see the misty mountains and fields of tea\u2026 Can you tell us what <strong>evocative</strong> means?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>It means making you imagine something pleasant. And for some people tea drinking is a spiritual experience. Let\u2019s listen to BBC reporter Mike Williams learning about the Asian custom of the tea ceremony.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>INSERT<br/>Mike Williams and his Chinese host<br/></span></strong><span><strong>CH:</strong> Please enjoy a mouthful of green tea.<br/></span><span><strong>MW:</strong> Thank you... That was a bit less than a mouthful. It's a very very small amount, isn't it?<br/></span><span><strong>CH:</strong> It's about 20ml. It's the way to appreciate tea in very small quantities so you can concentrate and cultivate your mindfulness in drinking the tea.<br/></span><span><strong>MW:</strong> Mindfulness? What do you mean by mindfulness?<br/></span><span><strong>CH:</strong> Tea ceremony has some of its origin in Buddhism. The Japanese tea ceremony for example has a lot of Zen Buddhism influence. Mindfulness is the concentration and focus on the now \u2013 forget about the past, forget about the future, and enjoy this specific moment. And that's what I call mindfulness. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>So they don't use mugs in the tea ceremony. It's 20 millilitres or a mouthful of green tea. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>That's right. Drinking just a <strong>mouthful</strong> \u2013 or a small amount \u2013 helps you concentrate and cultivate mindfulness. As the speaker explains, <strong>mindfulness</strong> means living in the moment and forgetting about the past and future. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, forgive me for thinking about the past \u2013 but how about the answer to today\u2019s quiz question?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>OK then. I asked: Where was the teabag invented? Was it in\u2026 </span><span>a) China?, </span><span>b) the US? of\u00a0</span><span>c) Britain?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And I said c) Britain. And I must be right.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Well, I'm afraid you're wrong, Neil! It was b) the US. Teabags first appeared commercially in the first decade of the 20th c</span><span>entury and were successfully marketed by Thomas Sullivan, a tea merchant from New York, who shipped his teabags around the world.</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Really? Teabags are older than I thought! Now, can you tell us the words we heard today?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>They are:<br/></span><span>brew<br/></span><span>consumed<br/></span><span>sanative<br/></span><span>medicinal<br/></span><span>elite<br/></span><span>evocative<br/></span><span>mouthful<br/></span><span>mindfulness</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

Well, Alice, I'm flattered. And today's show is about <strong>commuting</strong> \u2013 or travelling between your home and your work. So how did you commute this morning, Alice?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>I got the <strong>Tube</strong> \u2013 that's the subway system here in London, also known as the underground \u2013 and it was a nightmare. We stopped in a tunnel for so long that people started talking to each other.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And for those of you who aren't Londoners, that's unusual!

Can you spot a word that means being quick to notice things going on around you?</span></p>, <p><span><strong>INSERT<br/>Commuter, Nairobi, Kenya<br/></strong></span><span>When I'm stuck in the matatu there is a lot of strange things happen around you, so you have to be alert in Nairobi. When you open\u2026 when you leave your window open somebody can run away with your belongings. You may be speaking\u2026 using the phone\u2026 somebody just snatch your phone\u2026 you may expect the unexpected!\u00a0 </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>The word used by this commuter in Kenya is <strong>alert</strong>. And in these noisy, crowded buses you need to be alert in case someone runs away with your belongings \u2013 <strong>belongings</strong> are the things that you own.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Right. Somebody might snatch your phone \u2013 <strong>snatch</strong> means to take something quickly. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Public transport in Nairobi sounds stressful! If I was taking the bus I'd want to have a <strong>nap</strong> \u2013 or short sleep.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Yes. Well, people have done research on commuting and stress levels \u2013 and interestingly women are more likely to experience stress during their journey than men. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Why's that? </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Well, they're more likely to do something which is being called 'trip chaining' \u2013 where they make one or more stops on the way to work or going home \u2013 for example to drop off or pick up the kids from school \u2013 and this makes it more likely that something will go wrong with their journey.\u00a0 </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Even if you aren't trip chaining it's no fun being stuck in a <strong>traffic jam</strong> \u2013 that's a large number of vehicles \u200bclose together \u200bmoving \u200bslowly \u2013 or being packed into a crowded train like sardines. Let's face it \u2013 travelling by car or by public transport can be really miserable! </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Yes.<strong> Packed in like sardines</strong> describes people standing so close together that they can't move \u2013 like fish in a can! So let's hear how longer commutes can affect your health from US researcher Christine Hoehner.</span></p>, <p><span><strong>INSERT<br/>Christine Hoehner, researcher at Washington University School of Medicine<br/></strong></span><span>My study found that adults who commuted longer distances from home to work were less physically active, less physically fit, weighed more and had higher blood pressure than those people who had shorter commutes.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>The American researcher must be talking about commuters who aren't engaged in active travel, mustn't she? Because if you cycle a longer distance then you're being more physically active.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>I think you're right, for once, Neil!</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yeah. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>And I'd better start going to the gym more. I don't like the sound of high blood pressure. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Why don't you hop on your bike, Alice? Then we can both wear lycra to work.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>That's a fantastic idea, Neil! Moving on! Here's the answer to today's quiz question. I asked: What did the word 'commuter' originally describe? Was it someone who\u2026 a) travelled with other people? b) paid a reduced fare to travel? Or c) travelled by train to work?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And I said c) travelled by train to work. It must be right.</span></p>, <p><strong><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">Alice<br/></span></strong><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">And you were wrong I'm afraid, Neil! It's b) someone who paid a reduced fare to travel. The Oxford Dictionary says the word 'commute' comes from Latin <em>commutare</em>, from <em>com-</em> 'altogether' + <em>mutare</em> 'to change'. The word was used in the US in the 1840s, when people paid a reduced or <strong>commuted</strong> fare to travel by rail from the suburbs into the city.</span></p>, <p><span data-mce-mark=\"1\"><strong>Neil<br/></strong>OK.

An <strong>allergy</strong> by the way, is a condition that makes you feel ill after eating, touching or breathing in a particular substance. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And food allergies are the subject of today's show. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Alright, put your peanuts down, Neil and answer today's quiz question. What substance is used to treat a severe allergic reaction? Is it\u2026<br/></span><span>a) penicillin?<br/></span><span>b) adrenalin?<br/></span><span>Or c) aspirin?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>OK, well, I'm going to go for a) penicillin.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Well, we'll find out if that's the right answer later on. Now let's listen to Dr Marianne Williams talking about why being too clean may not be a good thing. She is a dietician here in the UK.</span></p>, <p><span><strong>INSERT<br/>Dr Marianne Williams, gastroenterology dietician, UK<br/></strong></span><span>For roughly the first month of life the immune system is switched off in essence and everything they [babies] get exposed to in that first month in life \u2013 dogs, cats, aunts, uncles, grannies, grandpas, family, dirt \u2013 everything \u2013 that is where they build up all the bacteria that are then going to colonise their gut in the future. Now, if you're born into a very sterile environment, as is increasingly the case in the western world, everything's kept terribly clean, and one of the theories is that we just are not getting enough exposure to a variety of bacteria at that very very early stage in that first month of life.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Dr Marianne Williams. The <strong>immune system</strong> is our body's defence against infection. And it's <strong>switched off</strong> \u2013 or not working \u2013 for the first month of a baby's life.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And through exposure to lots of things in our environment \u2013 that's family, pets, dirt and so on \u2013 young babies meet different bacteria for the first time which <strong>colonise</strong> \u2013 or live and grow in \u2013 their guts.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, but in a sterile environment babies don't <strong>get</strong> <strong>exposed to </strong>\u2013 or don't meet \u2013 a wide enough variety of bacteria.<strong> Sterile</strong> means completely clean and free of bacteria. And there's a theory that being too clean and bacteria-free \u2013 now we have soap, antibiotics and better sanitation \u2013 has lead to an increase in allergies.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>So dirty play for babies is good \u2013 mud, pets, picking stuff up off the floor and eating it.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Did you use to eat food off the floor when you were little, Neil?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Used to? I still do. I enjoy food from the floor! </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Well, Neil, what can I say? We're both lucky to be allergy-free. I have a friend who has an allergy to <strong>gluten</strong> \u2013 a protein found in wheat and some other grains \u2013 and she has to be very careful about what she eats so she doesn't get ill.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>The supermarkets are quite helpful, though, aren't they, with products 'free from this' and 'free from that'? </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>This is helpful, yes. But the food industry is now marketing their products to attract consumers who don't have a <strong>proven</strong> \u2013 or tested \u2013 allergy. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Why would you buy free-from foods if you don't have a food allergy? </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Well, people have started to believe that certain foods \u2013 like gluten or dairy \u2013 are bad for us, though there isn't any medical evidence to support this. Let's hear about how <strong>rickets</strong> \u2013 a disease caused by a lack of Vitamin D in the diet \u2013 is affecting some children in the UK. This is BBC reporter Mike Williams.</span></p>, <p><span><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Mike Williams,</strong> <strong>BBC reporter<br/></strong>R</span><span>ickets is common in the developing world but this is London in the 21st </span><span>century. These children aren't malnourished because they're too poor to eat well \u2013 it's the opposite. Their often middle-class parents are spending money to give them foods with ingredients taken out. It's as if some of us have become unnecessarily frightened of our food.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Rickets usually affects <strong>malnourished </strong>childrenfrom poor countries\u2013 children who don't have enough to eat \u2013 and it makes their bones weak. But here in London some parents are buying their children expensive free-from foods \u2013 for example to avoid dairy \u2013 and are sometimes making them very ill.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>It sounds crazy, doesn't it? </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yeah\u2026 it's <strong>nuts</strong>! Get it? Nuts.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Very good.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yes. Nuts - that means crazy. Now I think it's time for the answer to today's quiz question.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>OK, then. So earlier in the show I asked: What substance is used to treat a severe allergic reaction? Is it\u2026 a) penicillin?\u00a0 b) adrenalin?\u00a0 Or c) aspirin?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>I said a) penicillin.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>And you were wrong, Neil! The correct answer is b) adrenalin. An injection of adrenalin can be used to treat <strong>anaphylaxis</strong> \u2013 or severe allergic reactions \u2013 to insect stings, foods, drugs, and other allergens. Antibiotics such as penicillin treat bacterial infections and aspirin is a painkiller you might take for a headache.</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong></span><span>OK, can you tell us the words we heard today again please, Alice?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Sure.

Why do you ask?</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Today we're talking about how much sleep we need. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>I like a good eight hours myself \u2013 ten at the weekend. How about you?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Six is enough for me. But did you know this? Humans sleep around three hours less than other primates like chimps, who sleep for about ten hours. So you're a chimp, Neil \u2013 at the weekends, at least! Are you ready for the quiz question?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>[makes some chimp noises]</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>OK, I'll assume that means yes.

So what keeps you awake at night, Neil?\u00a0\u00a0</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Not much, to be honest. I usually <strong>sleep like a log</strong> \u2013 and that means very heavily indeed! But sometimes my own snoring wakes me up, and then I can find it hard to get back to sleep. <strong>Snoring</strong>, for those of you who don't know, means breathing in a noisy way through your mouth or nose while you're asleep. [snores] \u2026 like that\u2026 How about you, Alice?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Very good, yes. Well, that's quite ridiculous! Anyway, for me, it's drinking too much coffee during the day. It's the <strong>caffeine</strong> in coffee \u2013 a chemical that makes you feel more awake \u2013 which can stop you from sleeping at night. But there are so many things that can keep us awake these days. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Oh yes. Radio, TV\u2026 techy stuff like 24-hour internet, computers, smart phones. I love my phone and it's never far from me!</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Well, let's hear what Professor Jerome Siegel, from the University of California, found when he studied the sleep habits of three different hunter-gatherer communities who have very little contact with modern society. They don't have artificial light, electricity, batteries, or any of the gadgets that we rely on today.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>INSERT<br/></span></strong><span><strong>Professor Jerome Siegel, from the University of California, US<br/></strong></span><span>Their sleep was not that different from ours. The range of sleep period was about 6.9 to 8.5 hours. If you actually measure sleep in current populations in the United States or in Europe they're definitely at the low end of what's been reported. They certainly don't sleep a lot less than we do but they clearly don't sleep more.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Professor Jerome Siegel found that people in these communities don't go to bed until several hours after sundown \u2013 just like us! But one big difference is that very few of them suffer from <strong>insomnia</strong> \u2013 which means having difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Now, I don't have a problem with insomnia. And <strong>hunter-gatherers</strong> \u2013 people who live by hunting animals and gathering plants to eat \u2013 don't either \u2013 probably because they take a lot of physical exercise during the day.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, that's right. Taking exercise is an important factor in sleeping <strong>soundly</strong> \u2013 or well \u2013 at night. But these days our minds can be so active that it becomes very difficult to fall asleep. Let's listen to Professor Kevin Morgan, from Loughborough University here in England, talking about how cognitive behavioural therapy can be used to help people with insomnia.</span></p>, <p><span><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Professor Kevin Morgan, Loughborough University, England<br/></strong></span><span>If you have a train of thoughts which would otherwise keep you awake one way of dealing with this is to block those thoughts. What I'd like you to do is repeat the word 'the' in your mind at irregular intervals \u2013 the the the the the the the the the \u2013 what you'll find (is) that the mind space required to do this blocks out almost everything else.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>So Professor Kevin Morgan suggests saying one word over and over again at irregular intervals \u2013 <strong>irregular</strong> in this context means not spaced out evenly. Doing it can help to block out the thoughts that are stopping you from getting to sleep. It sounds like a very simple solution. I wonder if it works?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>There's one way to find out, Neil. Try it yourself!</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>I will.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>OK. And <strong>cognitive behavioural therapy</strong> by the way is a treatment for mental health problems that tries to change the way you think.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, I usually count sheep if I can't get to sleep. Do you do that, Alice?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>No, not usually. No. OK, I think it's time for the answer to our quiz question. I asked: What's another word for sleepwalking? Is it\u2026 a) narcolepsy? b) restless legs syndrome? or c) somnambulism?</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I said b) restless legs syndrome.</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Sorry, Neil, it's actually c) somnambulism \u2013 the roots of this word come from Latin. <em>Somnus</em> means 'sleep' and and <em>ambulare</em> means 'walk'. Narcolepsy is a condition where you can't stop yourself falling asleep, especially during the day. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Narcolepsy\u2026 (says in a sleepy way)</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>And restless legs syndrome is a condition that makes you desperate to move your legs around, especially when you're sitting quietly or trying to get to sleep. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>\u2026 get to sleep\u2026 (murmuring)</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Neil!

I'm Neil\u2026</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>\u2026 and I'm Alice. Now Neil, I'm a big fan of chat shows, as you know. But what do you think makes a good interview?</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I like it when the interviewer asks a question that <strong>catches</strong> the guest <strong>off guard</strong>. You know \u2013 to surprise them so they're embarrassed and don't know what to say. </span></p>, <p><span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>That's not very nice! </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>I know. But it's great TV. That's what chat shows are all about, isn't it?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Well, I don't agree, Neil! A <strong>chat show</strong>, by the way, is a TV or radio programme where a <strong>host</strong> \u2013 the person who presents the show \u2013 talks to guest celebrities about various topics. And what makes a good interview is the subject of today's show. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>So what's a good interview technique, Alice?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Well, asking <strong>open questions</strong> \u2013 questions the celebrities can't easily respond to with a short answer. Open questions give them the chance to talk and possibly reveal some juicy details about themselves!</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span><strong>Juicy details </strong>means information you find interesting because it's exciting or shocking. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Yes. So let's test your interviewing skills, Neil. Ask me something \u2013 see if you can get some juicy details. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>OK\u2026 Hmm\u2026 How much do you weigh?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>How much do I weigh? </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yeah.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>How much do <em>you</em> weigh? Look, that's a <strong>closed question</strong> \u2013 you're going to get a short answer and no juicy details! And more importantly, Neil, it's a rude question!</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>OK \u2013 bad choice. Sorry. But your reaction was juicy \u2013 you got pretty <strong>hot under the collar</strong> \u2013 and that means embarrassed or angry! I'll try to think of a better question to ask you before the end of the show.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Alright then. Now, since you aren't good at <em>asking</em> questions, perhaps you can <em>answer</em> one instead. Who developed a method of questioning around two and a half thousand years ago that aims to discover hidden truths? Was it\u2026<br/></span><span>a) Hippocrates?<br/></span><span>b) Socrates?<br/></span><span>Or c) Aristotle?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, I don't know much about ancient history so I'm going to guess c) Aristotle.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Well, we'll find out if you picked the right answer later on \u2013 but now let's listen to Larry King talking about the secret of his successful career as a TV chat show host. Can you spot a word that means to get or produce?</span></p>, <p><span><strong>INSERT<br/>Larry King, TV chat show host, US<br/></strong></span><span>If you ask good questions and you elicit thoughtful answers then you learn more about the person. If the interview's hard \u2013 if I begin by saying, 'Why did you do that?' I'd make you defensive. That may be thrilling television, but you don't learn a lot. I learned that the more I drew back, asked good questions, listened to the answers, cared about the guest \u2026 you make the camera disappear.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>The word Larry King used is\u2026 <strong>elicit</strong>. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Right. And <em>you</em> elicited a defensive reaction from me when you asked a not very thoughtful question about my weight. <strong>Defensive</strong> means protecting yourself from criticism or attack. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>OK, I wouldn't make a good chat show host then.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>You're right there. So good interviewers <strong>draw back</strong> \u2013 or move away \u2013 from being the centre of attention. They're good listeners and care about their guests. Sound familiar? </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Are you suggesting that you're a good interviewer?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Yup.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>OK, well, so why aren't you a top chat show host, hmm? What does Larry mean when he says you have to<strong> make the camera disappear</strong>?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>It means to make the conversation real \u2013 as if you were chatting with a friend \u2013 rather than performing to a TV audience. But let's hear more from Larry King on the secret of his success.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>INSERT</span></strong><br/><span><strong>Larry King, TV chat show host, US<br/></strong></span><span>I don't want a 'no'. I don't want a 'yes'. I want a 'why'. So in other words, I want to be a little kind of dumb. My friend Herbie said the secret of my success is being dumb. 'What do you mean by that?' </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>So you have to ask <strong>dumb</strong> \u2013 or stupid \u2013 questions to make a great chat show host! I knew it!</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Maybe there's hope for you yet, Neil.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Charming.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Lovely. OK, here's the answer to today's quiz question. I asked: Who developed a method of questioning around two and a half thousand years ago that aims to discover hidden truths? Was it\u2026 a) Hippocrates? b) Socrates? Or c) Aristotle?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And I said c) Aristotle.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>No, it was b) Socrates. All three were famous Greek philosophers but Socrates was the one who angered lots of important people by his <strong>probing</strong> \u2013 or investigative \u2013 questions \u2013 and this technique is called Socratic Dialogue. Socrates lived from 469 to 399 BC and he influenced philosophy so much that all previous thinkers have come to be known as Pre-Socratic. Despite this he declared \"All I know is that I know nothing\".</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Very noble. OK, a final question for you, Alice. What makes you happy? </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Working with such a fantastic co-presenter, Neil. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>That's nice! I'm embarrassed now.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Can you tell us the words we heard today?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Of course!<br/></span><span><br/></span><span>catch somebody off guard<br/></span><span>chat show<br/></span><span>host<br/></span><span>open questions<br/></span><span>juicy details<br/></span><span>closed question<br/></span><span>hot under the collar<br/></span><span>elicit<br/></span><span>defensive<br/></span><span>draw back<br/></span><span>make the camera disappear<br/></span><span>dumb<br/></span><span>probing</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

You're not looking in great shape\u2026</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I'm afraid so!

Why do you think appearance is so important to us, Neil?

Well, I think we all judge people according to the way they look. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>The subject of today's show is <strong>appearance</strong> or the way we look.

Well, show us you aren't just a pretty face by getting today's quiz question right. From a study done in the UK, which physical aspect of their appearance were men most likely to say was their favourite? Was it\u2026<br/></span><span>a) their hair?<br/></span><span>b) their face?<br/></span><span>Or c) their height?<br/><br/></span><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>OK, I'm going for a) hair. I like my hair.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>You have lovely hair, Neil.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Thank you.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>And a lot of it.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yes.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Anyway, we'll find out later whether you're right or not. Now, it's not only people who make quick decisions about others based on the way they look. Some animals do this too. Peahens \u2013 that's a female peacock - prefer male peacocks with lots of eyespots on their tail.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Why's that?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Well, one theory is that a male peacock's tail is a sign of his genes. <strong>Genes</strong> are part of the DNA in a cell that controls the physical development and behaviour of an animal. It takes lots of energy to grow a big tail, and to carry it around, so only the strongest, healthiest males can afford to do this.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>So what do men need in order to attract women, Alice? </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>A deep voice and a square jaw, according to research.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, let's listen now to fashion historian Amber Butchart describing what men used to do to <strong>enhance</strong> \u2013 or improve \u2013 their physical appearance. </span></p>, <p><span><strong>INSERT<br/>Amber Butchart, fashion historian and analyst<br/></strong></span><span>Men quite often would wear corsets throughout [the] 18<sup>th</sup> Century even into the 19<sup>th</sup> Century. It was possibly concerned with displaying status and rank rather than what we now define as physical attractiveness but I think the two were very bound up together. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>This was Amber Butchart. A <strong>corset</strong> is a tight-fitting piece of underwear that squeezes you in and makes your waist look smaller.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>I didn't know men used to wear corsets! That might make you talk in a high voice \u2013 and that wouldn't be very\u00a0attractive, would it?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Well, no, Neil. It's a very interesting look and sound for you\u2026 On a more serious note, Amber says that men weren't wearing these uncomfortable <strong>garments</strong> \u2013 or clothes \u2013 just to look more physically attractive \u2013 they were also doing it to display their status and rank.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span><strong>Status</strong> means the professional or social position of a person in relation to others. And <strong>rank</strong> is another way of saying the same thing. Do you think we still dress to impress, Alice \u2013 or are things a bit freer than they were in the 18<sup>th</sup> Century? I'm a jeans and T-shirt man, as you know. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Well yes, indeed, you don't have to be <strong>suited and booted</strong> for our job \u2013 and that means smartly dressed. But I think the way we dress is still important. But for women, particularly, I think we dress nicely for ourselves \u2013 not for anybody else. Sometimes I put on make-up \u2013 not because I'm going out \u2013 but because it makes me feel good.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>You always look nice \u2013 with or without make-up, Alice.<br/><br/></span><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Thank you, Neil! That's very nice. But let's listen now to academic Philippa Dietrich from the University of the West of England, Bristol, talking about valuing ourselves for all our attributes \u2013 not just our appearance.<br/><br/></span><span><strong>INSERT<br/>Philippa Dietrich, University of the West of England, Bristol<br/></strong></span><span>This focus just on appearance \u2013 on looks \u2013 really sends people the ideas that their bodies are just objects to be looked at. Having a belief system or focussing on your values in life or other attributes or personality characteristics or interests or anything else that's not to do with appearance is really important. Our bodies are not there to be looked that \u2013 they have functions.<br/><br/></span><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>What Philippa Dietrich said makes sense to me. We need to focus on our inner beauty. What do you think, Alice?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Well, I think you should stop posting selfies on social media then, Neil! Now here's the answer to today's quiz question. I asked: From a study done in the UK, which physical aspect of their appearance were men most likely to say was their favourite? Was it\u2026 a) their hair? b) their face? Or c) their height?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And I said a) hair. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>And you were wrong I'm afraid, Neil! It's c) height. A poll conducted by ComRes for BBC Radio found that when it comes to appearance, men were most likely to mention their height - 21% of them in fact said it was their favourite physical attribute whereas for women, 35% of them said their hair was their favourite thing. </span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, forget about my hair, Alice - I'm tall too, OK, so\u2026 you can tell us the words we heard today, please?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Here they are:<br/></span><span>get in shape<br/></span><span>overindulge<br/></span><span>New Year's resolution<br/></span><span>appearance<br/></span><span>genes<br/></span><span>corset<br/></span><span>garments<br/></span><span>status<br/></span><span>rank<br/></span><span>suited and booted</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

Ebenezer Scrooge is the main character in Charles Dickens' novel <em>A Christmas Carol</em>. He's a <strong>miser</strong> \u2013 and that means someone who loves money but hates spending it. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Indeed. Well, on the subject of <em>A Christmas Carol</em>, Neil, at the end of the story, what does Scrooge buy the Cratchit family for Christmas dinner? Is it\u2026<br/></span><span>a) a goose?<br/></span><span>b) a turkey?<br/></span><span>Or c) a chicken?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Hmm. Well, I haven't read the book so I'm going to guess a) a goose. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Well, we'll find out later if you chose the right answer. Now, Neil, I agree that Christmas shopping can sometimes feel pointless \u2013 but we mustn't forget what a magical time Christmas is for young children. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, that's true. I remember how hard it was to get to sleep on Christmas Eve \u2013 worrying that Santa Claus would get stuck in our chimney. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, well,<strong> eve</strong> means the day before something \u2013 in this case, Christmas Day. Parents tell their children that <strong>Santa Claus</strong> \u2013 an imaginary old man with a white beard and red clothes \u2013 will bring them presents at Christmas time. In the UK children believe that Santa comes down the chimney to get into the house.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>But it's not all fun. Increasing numbers of people these days are struggling for money at this time of year. Having enough food to feed their family is what matters most and buying presents comes further down the list. So let's listen now to a BBC Scotland report by Laura Maxwell. She's talking about a special event with lots of presents.</span></p>, <p><span><strong>INSERT<br/>Laura Maxwell, BBC Scotland, and Beatrice Caddell<br/></strong></span><span><strong>LM:</strong> Beatrice Cadell has just celebrated her 80</span><span><sup><span>th </span></sup></span><span>birthday. And instead of presents for her, she asked her friends to buy toys. <br/></span><span><strong>BC:</strong> Everyone that turned up to that birthday do was absolutely brilliant. Absolutely brilliant. And it's good for something like this. It's even better. It's even better \u2013 you know \u2013 somebody else can benefit. We don't need it. We're old. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>So Beatrice is celebrating her birthday and she told friends and family to buy toys instead of presents for her.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Right. She had the generous idea of <strong>donating</strong> \u2013 or giving \u2013 the toys to a <strong>toy bank</strong> \u2013 a place where toys are given away free to people in need. The toy bank then distributed Beatrice's toys to parents who couldn't afford to buy presents for their children at Christmas.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Yes. So Beatrice is happy that children can <strong>benefit</strong> \u2013 or be helped by her. She says she doesn't need presents. A woman <strong>after your own heart</strong>, Neil!</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Indeed! And that means Beatrice has the same opinion as me! Well, that's a great example of Christmas charity \u2013 and <strong>charity</strong> means giving free help to people who need it. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Yes. And here's another example, Neil. Last year in London, twenty tons of presents were donated, wrapped, and delivered to a local hospital to cheer up sick children who couldn't go home for Christmas.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Were they delivered in Santa's sleigh?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>No Neil, they were delivered in a big double-decker bus! Let's hear about the volunteers who made this happen. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>INSERT<br/>Volunteer<br/></span></strong><span>Lots of different groups of people come together under the banner of kindness \u2013 so religious people come together, corporate people come together, young people, old people \u2013 it seems to be something that stretches across many many many different demographics.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span><strong>Under the banner of kindness</strong> \u2013 what does that mean, Alice? </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Well,<strong> being under the banner of something</strong> means being part of a group who are united in support for an idea. And in this case, different people came together to do something kind for sick children.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And demographics? What's that?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span><strong>Demographics</strong> means statistical information about a population and the groups of people in it. People from different groups in society are working together \u2013 the old and the young, religious people, corporate \u2013 or business \u2013 people.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And this talk of kindness is making me feel more in the mood for Christmas! </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>I can see that, Ebenezer. You've got a smile on your face! Now, earlier in the show, I asked: At the end of the story, what does Scrooge buy the Cratchit family for Christmas dinner? Is it\u2026 a) a goose? b) a turkey? Or c) a chicken?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And I said a) a goose.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Yes. And you were wrong, Neil! The answer is b) a turkey. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>That makes me a goose.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>It certainly does. Scrooge buys the Cratchit family the prize turkey hanging. Delicious! <em>A Christmas Carol</em> is a lovely story. Everybody should read it.</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And did you know that although turkeys are traditional Christmas food now, they weren't in Dickens's time.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>I see...</span><span>\u00a0</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>They were <strong>exotic</strong> back then \u2013 and that means unusual because it comes from another country.

I'm Alice\u2026</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Finn<br/></strong>\u2026 and I'm Finn. Hello.</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Hello, Finn. You're off on holiday tomorrow, aren't you?</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Finn<br/></strong>I am and you know, and I'm dreading it. I hate flying! </span></p>, <p><span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Do you? I didn't know you had a <strong>phobia</strong> \u2013 and that means a strong and unreasonable fear of something.\u00a0\u00a0</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Well, I don't think this is a phobia because it isn't unreasonable. Flying thousands of feet up in the sky in a tin can, you know, that's not safe! </span></p>, <p><span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Flying is safer than you think, Finn. It's much riskier to drive or cycle to work. And, actually, risk taking is the subject of today's show! <strong>Risk</strong> means the chances of something bad happening. For example, did you know that your chance of being knocked off your bicycle and killed during a one-mile journey is the same as your chances of winning the lottery?</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Finn<br/></strong>You know Alice, I didn't know that. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>And this leads me on to our quiz question for today: What are the odds \u2026 what are the chances of either of these two things happening? Is it\u2026<br/></span><span>a) 1 in 4 million?<br/></span><span>b) 1 in 14 million?<br/></span><span>Or c) 1 in 400 million?</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Finn<br/></strong>I have no idea. I'll go with the big number: 1 in 400 million, c).</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Alice </strong>OK. So we'll find out later if you're right or wrong later on. Now let's listen to Andreas Wilkey, a psychologist at Clarkson University in New York, talking about why we're bad at assessing risk. </span></p>, <p><span><strong>INSERT </strong><strong>Andreas Wilkey, Psychologist, Clarkson University, Potsdam, New York<br/></strong></span><span>People typically fear anything which is small probability but it's extremely catastrophic if it were to happen\u2026 Think about dying in a plane crash, think about a nuclear meltdown from the nearby power plant. Recently we have another increase in these birds' virus outbreaks in South Korea. People read about that. And they may pay a lot of attention to that in the news but they may forget to get their flu shot. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>That was Andreas Wilkey from Clarkson University. And we heard that a small <strong>probability</strong> of something happening means it's unlikely to happen. But we worry about big or catastrophic events such as catching bird flu or dying in a plane crash because we have a <strong>gut</strong> <strong>reaction </strong>to them\u2013 in other words, we react emotionally. A <strong>catastrophic</strong> event is something that causes a huge amount of damage and suffering.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>And it's often because of <strong>media coverage</strong> \u2013 for example, watching the news and reading the newspapers \u2013 that it can be difficult for us to understand how likely certain things are to happen. Catastrophic events feel like very real threats, while we tend to forget about the small but chronic risks that become more likely over time.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>We do.<strong> Chronic</strong> means something that lasts for a long time. So for example, what if there was a cigarette that killed you as soon as you smoked it? Nobody would do that, would they?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>No, they wouldn't.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>But plenty of people are happy to smoke for years, and put off worrying about the health risks for the future.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, that's a good point, Finn! People feel they are in control of risks that stretch over time. You know, they think, 'I could stop tomorrow' or 'I could smoke less'. But what about people who enjoy taking big risks \u2013 those <strong>thrill seekers</strong> out there? </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>People who enjoy extreme sports actually seek out danger \u2013 it gives them extreme pleasure! So let's listen to Karina Hollekim from Norway. She's a <strong>base jumper</strong> \u2013 that's a person with a parachute who leaps from tall buildings or cliffs \u2013 and she's talking about what she feels about risk.</span></p>, <p><span><strong>INSERT </strong><strong>Karina Hollekim, base jumper<br/></strong></span><span>You need to measure the pleasure. Is it going to be worth it for you? So if the risk is really high, it means that the pleasure needs to be equally high. Or hopefully even higher\u2026 You can't measure it on a scale or anything. For me, it's a stomach feeling. It's the value within me, and I'm the only one who can tell what value it has to me. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Yes. It must be a magical feeling to step off a cliff, mustn't it, Finn?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>'It's a stomach feeling', you know \u2013 my stomach would definitely be saying, 'oh no, no, no!' So why not change the subject and give me the answer to today's quiz question?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>I asked: What are your chances of being knocked off your bicycle and killed during a one-mile journey and this is the same as your chances of winning the national lottery? So is it\u2026 a) 1 in 4 million? b) 1 in 14 million? Or c) 1 in 400 million?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>I said c) 1 in 400 million.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Yes. And you were wrong, Finn. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>Alright. Really? OK.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Yes. The odds are actually 1 in 14 million. You are as likely to win the national lottery from a single ticket as you are to be knocked off your bicycle and killed during a one-mile journey. This statistic comes from the Professor David Spiegelhalter, who is Winton Professor of the Public Understanding of Risk in the Statistical Laboratory at the University of Cambridge in the UK. So I think he really knows his stuff.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>That's a very long title, yes, I'm sure he does. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Yeah.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>So let's hear today's words again, Alice?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Here they are:<br/></span><span>phobia<br/></span><span>risk<br/></span><span>probability<br/></span><span>gut reaction<br/></span><span>catastrophic<br/></span><span>media coverage<br/></span><span>chronic<br/></span><span>thrill seekers<br/></span><span>base jumper<br/></span><span>And that brings us to the end of today's 6 Minute English.

Did you talk to anyone about your feelings, Neil? Did you get any <strong>counselling</strong>? And that means professional help with personal or psychological problems.</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>What? No, not me. I'm one of those men who isn't good at talking about their feelings, Alice. I just felt a bit <strong>homesick</strong> that's all \u2013 I missed my friends and family. But let's move on, shall we! Why don't you ask me today's quiz question? </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Alright then. So here it is: In a survey of students at Imperial College London, how many students said they suffered from high levels of stress or a mental health condition during their time at college? Was it\u2026<br/></span><span>a) 1 out of 4?<br/></span><span>b) 2 out of 4?<br/></span><span>or c) 3 out of 4?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, I'm going to go for c) 3 out of 4 because I do think that university life can be more stressful than people realize.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Yes. And <strong>stress</strong> means pressure or worry caused by a difficult situation. OK, we'll find out if you're right or wrong later on. Now in the UK, there has been a rise in students using counselling services.</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Why's that, Alice? </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Well, let's listen to Kirsty, a student at Exeter University, talking about why she has had problems. And here's a question for you while you listen: Did she enjoy her first days in college?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>INSERT</span></strong><br/><span><strong>Kirsty McMurron, student at Exeter University<br/></strong></span><span>No. The thing is\u2026 it\u2026 is a real balancing act. When I first got to university I don't think I'd really realized that I'd forgotten how to make friends you know, I'd been with the same school friends for seven years, and so I was trying to balance you know social success with academic success whilst learning how to look after myself at quite a young age. And I think that's the experience of a lot of young people. And people really struggle with it.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>What's a <strong>balancing act</strong>, Alice?</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>It's where you try to give your attention to two or more things at the same time. So here, Kirsty is trying to balance making new friends with doing her academic work and learning to look after herself.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>What does Kirsty mean when she says she's learning to look after herself?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Well, to <strong>look after someone</strong> means to protect or take care of someone \u2013 and in this case, Kirsty's learning to take care of herself \u2013 for example doing her own shopping and cooking. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>OK, let's listen to Dr Ruth Caleb of the counselling service at Brunel University in London talking about what practical stuff students could learn before leaving for university that might make life easier for them.</span></p>, <p><span><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Dr Ruth Caleb, Head of the counselling service at Brunel University, London<br/></strong></span><span>Certain things that I think it would be very very helpful for students to have put in place are an ability to do the practical things of life \u2013 to do the washing, to do the cleaning and so on \u2013 being able to cook. Budgeting is extremely important in university life. And also spending time on your own comfortably.</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, that's excellent advice. I couldn't boil an egg when I arrived at uni.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice</span></strong><br/><span>Oh, really? Can you do it now, Neil? </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Just about, just about.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Yeah? Great. And what about <strong>budgeting</strong>? This means planning how much money you have and how you will spend it.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil</span></strong><br/><span>I'm still pretty bad at that. However, I am very good at spending time on my own comfortably. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, I can believe that \u2013 feet up, watching TV with a takeaway. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Takeaway, of course a takeaway cause I can't cook anything\u2026</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>No.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>\u2026 not even an egg. You know me so well. So how about the answer to today's quiz question, Alice?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Alright then. I asked: In a survey of students at Imperial College London, how many said they suffered from high levels of stress or a mental health condition during their time at college? Was it\u2026<br/></span><span>a) 1 out of 4?<br/></span><span>b) 2 out of 4?<br/></span><span>or c) 3 out of 4?</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I said c) 3 out of 4.</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Yes. And you are correct \u2013 well done, Neil! The survey, completed by over a thousand students, also found that almost 70% of those that suffer from stress do so at least once a week, and 9% of students feel <strong>stressed</strong> constantly. Stressed means anxious and worried.</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, I feel anxious just thinking about all that stress. Can we hear today's words again?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>We certainly can.

Now, why do you think the stories of Robin Hood have lasted from the Middle Ages through to the modern day?</p>, <p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Well, I suppose it's got appeal on lots of levels \u2013 action, adventure \u2013 there's some comedy stuff there with the merry men. And of course, romance, like I said before.</p>, <p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>Yes, indeed. Actually the early versions of Robin Hood were very violent. Let's listen to Professor Thomas Hahn talk about one of the ballads called The Monk.</p>, <p><strong>INSERT</strong><br/><strong>Thomas Hahn, Professor of English Literature at the University of Rochester, New York<br/></strong>The Monk is, I think for most modern audiences who've either seen movies or read children's stories or whatever, quite disturbing in terms of its levels of violence. In terms of trying to make some comparisons with popular culture it seems to me that it's really at the level of Sopranos in terms of things like dismembered bodies and actual violence and assassinations.</p>, <p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>What's a ballad, Alice?</p>, <p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>Well, It's a song or poem that tells a story. People were telling the stories of Robin Hood for a long time before they were written down \u2013 and performing them too.</p>, <p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Really? And how about the comparison between the Robin Hood ballads and the Sopranos? Now The Sopranos is a popular US TV series about gangsters. Maybe I should get The Monk on audiobook. What do you think?</p>, <p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>Yes, I don\u2019t think you'd find it disturbing \u2013 disturbing means making you feel upset or shocked. Assassinations are the murder of important people, often for political reasons. And dismembered bodies are bodies that have been cut or torn into pieces.</p>, <p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Right. It sounds like medieval entertainment for guys. You know, like martial arts movies these days.</p>, <p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>Well, yes, you may be right. Now do you remember you mentioned Maid Marion at the start of the show?</p>, <p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>I do.</p>, <p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>Well, actually, in the early ballads there is no Maid Marian. She appears in later versions along with other characters we know well today. But Robin is always a trickster, and a man with a bow in a wood.</p>, <p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>A trickster is someone who deceives or cheats people. That's impressive, Alice. You certainly know your medieval ballads.</p>, <p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>Yes, I do. So what's so appealing about this man with a bow? Let's listen to Professor Hahn again.</p>, <p><strong>INSERT</strong><br/><strong>Thomas Hahn, Professor of English Literature at the University of Rochester, New York<br/></strong>What he represents I think is a kind of strong and forceful masculinity that operates on its own terms and for its own interests and that's I think what we admire in these stories.</p>, <p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>What does it mean to operate on your own terms, Alice?</p>, <p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>Well, Neil, it means to do what you want according to your own rules. And masculinity means the qualities typical of a man. Now, remember my question from earlier? I asked: When do we find the first reference to Robin Hood in English literature? Was it in the\u2026<br/>a) 5th century?<br/>b) 10th century?<br/>Or c) 14th century?</p>, <p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>And I said b) 10th century.</p>, <p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>Yes, well\u2026 I'm afraid you are wrong, Neil. The first reference occurs in the English poet William Langland's book Piers Plowman written between 1370 and 1390. Sloth, the lazy priest, says: \"I kan not parfitly my Paternoster as the preest it singeth,/ But I kan rymes of Robyn Hood and Randolf Erl of Chestre.\"</p>, <p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Well, Alice, can you translate that into modern English, please? Maybe that's for another show.</p>, <p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>Maybe another show\u2026</p>, <p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Can we just have today's words again, please?</p>, <p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>We certainly can. And we can have those in modern English. OK. Here they are:<br/>outlaw<br/>medieval period or Middle Ages<br/>ballad<br/>disturbing<br/>assassinations<br/>dismembered bodies<br/>trickster<br/>operate on your own terms<br/>masculinity</p>, <p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Well, that brings us to the end of today's 6 Minute English.

I'm Alice\u2026</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>\u2026 and I'm Neil. Hello.</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Hello, Neil. Now tell me, do you usually go dutch when you take someone out to dinner?</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Now <strong>go dutch</strong> means to share the cost of something, for example a meal in a restaurant. Well Alice, no, I usually expect my date to pay actually. </span></p>, <p><span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>I hope you're joking, Neil. But I wouldn\u2019t be surprised! Personally, I think it's a nice gesture to offer to pay for the meal when you're on a date. </span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yeah. But it can depend on the situation \u2013 some people might be very offended if you offered to pay for everything! </span></p>, <p><span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well yes, true. Clearly you're not going to offend those people, Neil, though are you? And I won\u2019t be going to dinner with you any time soon. </span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, I didn't ask so calm down, Alice! Actually, money matters can cause relationship problems in couples \u2013 and that's the subject of the show. Here's today's quiz question based on a UK survey. Ready, Alice?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>I am indeed.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>What percentage of married couples don't know exactly what their spouse earns? Is it:<br/></span><span>a) 4%?<br/></span><span>b) 14%?<br/></span><span>Or c) 44%</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well, gosh! I think b) 14%. Yes, that sounds about right to me.</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, we'll find out if you're right or wrong later on. Now, it seems important that couples are honest about their finances because it can have an impact on their future financial options together. </span></p>, <p><span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Yes, that's right. If you're buying a house together and then find out later that your <strong>spouse</strong> \u2013 your husband or wife \u2013 is thousands of pounds in debt, then the chances are you won't be able to get a mortgage. <strong>To be in debt</strong>, by the way, means to owe money to someone.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Good point. A <strong>mortgage</strong> is where a bank lends you money to buy a house. Let's listen now to what Arabella Russell, a relationship therapist, has to say about this. </span></p>, <p><span><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Arabella Russell, relationship therapist<br/></strong></span><span>The fact of the matter is it's very difficult \u2013 it can be very difficult \u2013 to talk about money. Often when we talk about money, it\u2019s emotions very close to us \u2013 there's guilt, there's shame. What have we done in the past? To start those conversations is complicated. Money can be about how we value ourselves, how we feel valued. It\u2019s not just a simple case of talking about hard cash. </span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Arabella talks about 'hard cash'. Now what does that mean? </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice</span></strong><br/><span>Well, we say <strong>hard cash</strong> when we talk about physical money \u2013 the coins and banknotes \u2013 as opposed to other types of payment.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil</span></strong><br/><span>And why do we find it so difficult to talk about cash, Alice?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Well, because we get emotional about it! Arabella talks about feelings of guilt and shame. And for many of us, money isn't simply money \u2013 it can be about how we value ourselves or feel valued.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Right \u2013 so if I were to buy you a cheap engagement ring you would feel undervalued.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Nice example, Neil! You can't be a cheapskate when it comes to engagement rings! So how much would you spend on our engagement ring, Neil?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well\u2026 um\u2026 I didn't know we were getting married! \u00a0But if I was buying an engagement ring for you Alice, I think definitely I would spend about\u2026 you know around... in the region of \u2026 mmm pounds\u2026 </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Sorry, Neil, I didn't quite catch that. Alright!</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Are you calling me a cheapskate?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>I certainly am, Neil. <strong>Cheapskate</strong> means someone who doesn't like spending money, by the way. Moving on \u2013 let's hear more from Arabella about how people have different attitudes towards money.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>INSERT</span></strong><br/><strong><span>Arabella Russell, relationship therapist<br/></span></strong><span>Accept the fact that in your relationship you might do money differently \u2013 there might be a spender there might be a saver. It\u2019s very tempting if your partner does things differently to say they're wrong. They might do it differently because they see money differently. Do it differently but have a budget. Of course be honest about each other but recognise that you might just have a different view of money.</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Now that sounds like excellent advice to me! I'm a saver, and I'm not ashamed to say it. Why waste money on an expensive engagement ring? Engagements don't always last. You might drop the ring down the kitchen sink or\u2026 </span></p>, <p><span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>How romantic, Neil! </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>\u2026 it could be stolen or you might meet someone else.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice</span></strong><br/><span>Indeed. Now I know I shouldn't say you're wrong\u2026 but you're wrong! You have to invest in a relationship if you want it to work. </span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Calm down. I see money differently to you. I\u2019m a saver and you\u2019re a spender, and that\u2019s all there is to it. And a <strong>budget</strong> means the money you have available for something and a plan for how to use it.</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well, we'll have to <strong>agree to differ</strong>. And that means accept that we have different opinions on this one! Can we have the answer to today's quiz question then, please?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, we can. I asked: What percentage of married couples don't know exactly what their spouse earns? Is it:<br/></span><span>a) 4%?<br/></span><span>b) 14%?<br/></span><span>Or c) 44%</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>And I said b) 14%.</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And you are absolutely and completely\u2026 wrong! The correct answer is 44%. Now that's according to new research conducted by the UK credit report service, Noddle, who also found that an astonishing 1.9 million married couples actively try to keep their finances secret from their partners!</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Gosh, what a lot of people! Can we have today's words again then, Neil, please?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, we can. Here they are:<br/></span><span>go dutch<br/></span><span>spouse<br/></span><span>to be in debt<br/></span><span>mortgage<br/></span><span>hard cash<br/></span><span>cheapskate<br/></span><span>budget <br/></span><span>agree to differ</span><strong><span>\u00a0</span></strong></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Well, that brings us to the end of today's 6 Minute English.

I'm Catherine\u2026<br/><br/><strong>Li<br/></strong>\u2026and I'm Li. And today we are talking about women's rights. Catherine, do you think women's rights are well covered by the media?<br/><br/><strong>Catherine<br/></strong><strong>Covered</strong> means 'talked about'. And I would say it could be better, to be honest. Many women's magazines are all about beauty tips, fashion and how to please your man. Now, I'm interested in the real issues. One thing the media doesn't talk about much is what the role of childless women, like myself, is. And <strong>childless</strong> means 'having no children'.<br/><br/><strong>Li<br/></strong>Yes. In some societies, the <strong>role</strong> of women \u2013 role, the way they are expected to behave \u2013\u00a0is to have children. If they don't, it's like there's something wrong with them, and they are supposed to be unhappy.<br/><br/><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>I have no children and I'm very happy. Anyway, women in various countries around the world want to discuss problems which are close to home. And that's why the BBC has organised a series of programmes to discuss some issues that affect half the world's population. The series is called 100 Women and it's the theme of this 6 Minute English.<br/><br/><strong>Li<br/></strong>The <strong>discrimination</strong> against women happens in different ways in different countries.<br/><br/><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Discrimination means the unjust treatment of people who belong to different groups - in this case, male and female. Maybe Li, more women should be in positions of power. And that's what today's quiz question is about. Li, how many female heads of state or government do we have around the world now, in 2015? Is it:\u00a0</p>, <p>a)\u00a09<br/>b)\u00a019 or<br/>c)\u00a029</p>, <p><strong><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">Li<br/></span></strong><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">Well, I'm going to guess\u2026 c) 29. </span></p>, <p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>That's very optimistic and we'll find out later if you're right. Now, let's talk about the BBC's 100 Women season. The season will include programmes across all the BBC platforms \u2013 including radio, online, TV and social media. And the BBC's Tammi Walker is working on the social media offer. Here she is, explaining what audiences can expect.</p>, <p><strong><span>INSERT</span></strong><br/><strong><span>Tammi Walker, BBC social media producer for 100 Women<br/></span></strong><span>Within the season we've got big debates. One is \"Is news failing women?\", which is obviously <strong>at the core</strong> of what we are trying to get to. And that will be a live debate held in London but we're going to have people speaking in different countries about that. And we're also doing a big debate called \"What does it mean to be a good girl or an ideal woman?\". December the 1<sup>st</sup> we have three topics - leadership, relationships and image - and we're going to do three live debates on that day. And we've sent out packs to over 100 women's groups around the world, so that on the day they all get involved.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Li<br/></span></strong><span>So at the core of the project 100 Women there will be live debates. By the way, the word 'core' means 'the central part of it'.</span></p>, <p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Indeed. And as you know Li, in some countries, women face some fairly basic problems\u2026 Here's\u00a0<strong>Tammi Walker</strong> again. And this time, what word means, well, you know, what you do when you go to the toilet?</p>, <p><strong><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">INSERT</span></strong><br/><strong><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">Tammi Walker, BBC social media producer for 100 Women<br/></span></strong><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">We are tying in with World Toilet Day, with the right to <strong>pee</strong>. For example in India, women are charged 25 rupees to go to the toilet whereas men obviously can go anywhere for free. You don't have to pay to go! </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Li<br/></span></strong><span>Yes. Women in India have to pay to pee \u2013 it means to urinate, to pass water \u2013 while men can go anywhere. It is a matter of public health too. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Most definitely. Now, this is the third BBC 100 Women season. Last time it prompted a big discussion in Iran. Let's hear what Sanam Dolatshahi has to say. She's a producer from BBC Persian. And can you understand what the word <strong>sexism</strong> means?</span></p>, <p><span><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Sanam Dolatshahi, producer,\u00a0BBC Persian<br/></strong></span><span>Many people are familiar with other 'isms' you know \u2013 for example, racism. When you say 'racism' people know what it means in Iran. But not necessarily sexism. Many people confused it with sex. So some people were asking us: Air your programmes about sexism after the watershed, after 9 pm, you know, so that the children will not watch. </span></p>, <p><strong>Li<br/></strong>Sexism means to have a very strict idea of what each sex can or can't do and it is a form of prejudice. Sometimes people are prejudiced and they don't even know it.</p>, <p><strong><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">Catherine<br/></span></strong><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">Absolutely. But this prejudice, whether known or unknown, can bring a lot of suffering. Well, there's a lot more we could say about women in our society but we are running out of time. So let's get back to our quiz question Li\u2026</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Li<br/></span></strong><span>Yeah. You asked me about women in powerful positions\u2026<br/><br/></span><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>That's right. I asked you: How many heads of state or government do we have around the world now, in 2015? Is it:</span></p>, <p><span>a)</span>\u00a0<span>9<br/></span><span>b)</span>\u00a0<span>19 or<br/></span><span>c)</span>\u00a0<span>29</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Li<br/></span></strong><span>And I said c) 29.<br/><br/></span><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Unfortunately Li, it's wrong! The correct answer is b) 19. And according to a 2015 United Nations report, in 1995 there were only 12 female heads of state or government but now there are 19. And before you go let me remind you of some of the key words we've used today. They were:</span></p>, <p><span>covered<br/></span><span>childless<br/></span><span>role<br/></span><span>discrimination <br/></span><span>at the core<br/></span><span>pee<br/></span><span>sexism<br/><br/></span><strong><span>Li<br/></span></strong><span>Well, that just about brings us to the end of today's 6 Minute English.

The subject of today's show is\u2026 what makes us laugh. And in this context, to get something, for example a gag \u2013 or joke, means to understand it. We all like to laugh \u2013 well not you apparently \u2013 but most of us do! It's good for our health, it reduces stress and releases feel-good hormones in the body.</p>, <p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>OK, thank you, Neil. But how about answering today's quiz question? Which Greek word means the study of laughter and its effects on the body? Is it\u2026<br/>a) risology?<br/>b) gelotology?<br/>or c) comology?</p>, <p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>That's difficult and I'm going to say c) comology because it's got the word 'comedy' in it, you see?</p>, <p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>Oh, very good. OK. Well, we'll find out later if you're right. Now, did you know, we rarely laugh when we're on our own? Laughter is a social thing that we generally like to share with other people.</p>, <p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Really? I laugh when I'm watching cartoons on my own \u2013 don't you, Alice?</p>, <p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>No, Neil, I don't. Anyway, some researchers believe that the purpose of laughter is related to the way we bond with each other. And the more we laugh, the more we bond as a group.</p>, <p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Interesting idea. It could explain why stand-up comedy \u2013 where a comedian performs in front of and talks directly to their audience \u2013 is very popular entertainment. But what does it take to keep your audience laughing? Let\u2019s listen to Steve Byrne, a successful US comedian talking about this.</p>, <p><strong>INSERT</strong><br/><strong>Steve Byrne, comedian</strong><br/>The one single thing an aspiring comedian should do is to write, write, write and talk about the things that make them laugh. Selfishness \u2013 time to be selfish \u2013 time to be a little narcissistic. What is it that makes you laugh? Because that will get you closer to finding your voice. Because ultimately that's why people come see you.</p>, <p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>So comedians need to be selfish and narcissistic \u2013 that sounds pretty negative!</p>, <p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>Yes, it does. Narcissistic means being too interested in yourself \u2013 for example your appearance or other personal qualities. And aspiring means wanting to be successful in your chosen career.</p>, <p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>And what does Steve mean when he says comedians need to find their voice?</p>, <p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>Well, he means they need to talk about what they think in a way that's unique \u2013 meaning unusual or special \u2013 to them.</p>, <p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>OK. Let's listen to Steve again talking about turning 40 and what he finds funny about that.</p>, <p><strong>INSERT</strong><br/><strong>Steve Byrne, comedian</strong><br/>When you turn 40 you will hear this in your life and hopefully you'll hear this the rest of your life. 'You look good for 40. You look good for 52. You look great for 63.' You never hear that when you're young. You never hear: 'You look good for 19.'<br/><br/>You think there's going to be some magic potion \u2013 some magic shortcut to it all. It's writing and getting up on stage. It takes a lot of perseverance and it's such a competitive occupation. You know, you've just got to outwork everybody.</p>, <p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Well, we heard Steve making his audience laugh there. And by the way, Alice, you look fantastic for 40.</p>, <p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>That's not funny, Neil. I'm only 39 and you know it. Anyway, moving on, Steve says there's no magic potion or shortcut to success. You have to work hard \u2013 it doesn't happen by itself. And perseverance means to keep on trying to achieve something even when it's difficult.</p>, <p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>He says you have to outwork everybody \u2013 which means to work harder than everybody else. Steve certainly doesn't make comedy sound much fun, does he?</p>, <p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>No. In fact some people say there's a connection between depression and comedy \u2013 that comedians can be introverted and depressive.</p>, <p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Is that right? Introverts are generally quiet people who are more interested in their own thoughts and feelings than in spending time with other people.</p>, <p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>Yes, you'd think that most comedians would be extroverts \u2013 people who are lively and enjoy the company of others. OK I think it's time for the answer to our quiz question, Neil. I asked: Which Greek word means the study of laughter and its effects on the body? Is it\u2026<br/><br/>a) risology?<br/>b) gelotology?<br/>or c) comology?</p>, <p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Yes. I said c) comology, which I think I'm beginning to regret now.</p>, <p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>Yes, well, indeed. Sorry, I'm afraid that's the wrong answer. It's actually b) gelotology \u2013 which comes from the Greek word, gelos, meaning laughter.</p>, <p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>OK. You can stop sniggering now, Alice and just tell us today's words once again?</p>, <p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>Alright then. Here they are:<br/>get something (e.g. a joke)<br/>gag<br/>stand-up comedy<br/>narcissistic<br/>aspiring<br/>unique<br/>perseverance<br/>outwork<br/>introverts<br/>extroverts</p>, <p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Well, that just about brings us to the end of today's 6 Minute English.</p>, <p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>See you next time.</p>, <p><strong>Both</strong><br/>Bye.</p>]", "transcriptTitle": "Transcript", "vocabularyDetail": "[<p><strong><span>get something (idiomatic)</span></strong><strong><br/></strong><span>understand </span></p>, <p><strong><span>gag</span></strong><strong><br/></strong><span>joke or funny story</span></p>, <p><span><strong>stand-up comedy<br/></strong>a type of comedy where a comedian performs in front of and talks directly to their audience</span></p>, <p><strong><span>narcissistic</span></strong><br/><span>being too interested in yourself \u2013 for example your appearance or other personal qualities</span></p>, <p><strong><span>aspiring</span></strong><br/><span>wanting to be successful in your chosen career</span></p>, <p><strong><span>unique</span></strong><br/><span>unusual or special</span></p>, <p><strong><span>perseverance</span></strong><br/><span>to keep on trying to achieve something even when it\u2019s difficult</span></p>, <p><strong><span>outwork</span></strong><br/><span>work harder than everybody else</span></p>, <p><strong><span>introverts</span></strong><br/><span>people who are generally quiet and more interested in their own thoughts and feelings than in spending time with other people</span></p>, <p><strong><span>extroverts</span></strong><br/><span>people who are generally lively, outgoing, and enjoy the company of others</span></p>]", "vocabularyTitle": "Vocabulary"}, {"index": "0", "audio": "http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/learningenglish/features/6min/151105_6min_english_plastic_bags_download.mp3", "heading": "The impact of plastic", "id": "ep-151105", "questionDetail": "[<p>How many tonnes of plastic rubbish from the UK is being sent to China each year for recycling?

I'm Alice\u2026</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>\u2026 and I'm Neil. Hello.</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Hello, Neil. Have you been shopping?</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, I went a bit mad with my credit card actually. </span></p>, <p><span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Gosh, I can see that! But look at all those plastic bags. Why don't you use your own bags? </span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>You know what, I'm going to. Because they're now charging 5p per bag!</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Don't you follow the news, Neil? It's a recent government <strong>initiative</strong> \u2013 which means a new plan for dealing with something \u2013 in this case, to cut the number of thin plastic bags being given away in shops. And the environmental impact of plastic is the subject of today's show.</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Is England the first country to charge for these bags, Alice?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>No \u2013 other countries in the UK started charging a few years ago. And countries around the world including Bangladesh, South Africa, China, and Italy have actually banned them altogether.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Interesting. But I don't throw my bags away, Alice. I put them under the kitchen sink. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Are you a <strong>hoarder</strong>, Neil? That means someone who collects large amounts of stuff and can't throw things away.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Maybe I am\u2026 But seriously, with the 5p charge I'm definitely going to recycle my plastic bags. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Good. Now let me ask you today's quiz question, Neil: How many tonnes of plastic rubbish from the UK is being sent to China each year for recycling? Is it:<br/></span><span>a) 20,000?<br/></span><span>b) 200,000?<br/></span><span>or c) 2,000,000?</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well I think it's \u2026 a) 20,000. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>We'll find out if you're right or wrong later on. But first, why are plastic bags bad for the environment?</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Because they're too thin? And when they break all your shopping falls out? That must be it.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>No. They take hundreds of years to <strong>decompose</strong> \u2013 or break down by natural chemical processes. And also people don't dispose of them properly. They litter our streets. They <strong>clog </strong>\u2013 or block \u2013 drains and sewers. They spoil the countryside and damage wildlife.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well that's quite a list. So what's the solution then, Alice?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Well to either recycle or stop using plastic bags. But let's hear about the pharmaceutical company with another idea. This is BBC reporter John Maguire.</span></p>, <p><span><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>John Maguire, BBC reporter<br/></strong></span><span>At this company laboratory in North London they're testing how bags made with a special additive break down when exposed to sunlight, oxygen and heat\u2026 The technology was discovered by a British scientist in the 1970s and is now sold to around half the world's countries. In some, biodegradable bags are backed by law. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And <strong>biodegradable</strong> means able to break down naturally in a way that isn't harmful to the environment.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>So adding small amounts of a chemical to the plastic \u2013 a special <strong>additive</strong> \u2013 allows the plastic to break down in the open air. But if the technology was discovered back in the 1970s, why aren't these biodegradable bags being used in <em>every</em> country by now?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>I have no idea, Alice. Maybe they aren't as strong as non-biodegradable bags. I like a good strong bag, myself, you see.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Alright. Well, just go and buy yourself some canvas bags, Neil! In fact, I'll get you some for your birthday. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Thank you.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>You're very welcome. Now, moving on. Out of around 300 million tons of plastic produced every year, some goes in <strong>landfill</strong> \u2013 a place where our rubbish is buried under the earth \u2013 but about 10% of plastic ends up in the sea. Let's listen to Biologist Dr Pennie Lindeque from Plymouth Marine Laboratory talking about this.</span></p>, <p><span><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Biologist Dr Pennie Lindeque from Plymouth Marine Laboratory<br/></strong></span><span>We're already finding that there's a lot of microplastics in the sea and that some of these microplastics are actually being ingested by the zooplankton that live there. We're also concerned this could end up being passed up through the food chain to food which is destined for human consumption so it could end up on your or my plate.</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>What are <strong>microplastics</strong>, Alice?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice</span></strong><br/><span>They're small plastic fragments less than 5mm in size. You find them in cosmetic products such as facial scrubs, shower gel, and toothpaste. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil</span></strong><br/><span>And I'm guessing that <strong>ingested</strong> means 'eaten'? </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, the <strong>zooplankton</strong> \u2013 tiny little animals in the sea \u2013 mistake the microplastics for food and eat them. And because the zooplankton and humans are in the same food chain \u2013 they're at the bottom and we're at the top \u2013 but we're still connected \u2013 we may end up eating them and the microplastics inside them!</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>That doesn't sound very tasty! Now a <strong>food chain</strong>, by the way, refers to a series of living things where each creature feeds on the one below it in the chain.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Indeed. OK. Remember my question from earlier? I asked: How many tonnes of plastic rubbish from the UK is being sent to China each year for recycling? Is it\u2026<br/></span><span>a) 20,000?<br/></span><span>b) 200,000?<br/></span><span>or c) 2,000,000?</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I said a) 20,000.</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Yes but you're wrong, I'm afraid. The answer is b) 200,000 tonnes. And that statistic comes from the University of Cambridge in the UK. </span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>That's a load of rubbish! Get it \u2013 load of rubbish?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Very good.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Can we hear today's words again please?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>We certainly can.

I'm Rob\u2026</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And hello! I'm Neil.</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Hi there Neil. Have you ever had a close encounter with a monkey or an ape?\u00a0 </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well I\u2019m sitting right next to you, Rob?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Very funny.\u00a0Neil is referring to the fact that all humans are descended from apes, and apes and monkeys belong to a group of animals called <strong>primates</strong>.\u00a0 The difference is that monkeys have tails, and apes don\u2019t.\u00a0 </span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, I didn\u2019t know that. On a serious note\u2026 I had <strong>a close shave</strong> with some monkeys once in Bali.</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>A close shave is where you only just manage to avoid a dangerous situation. So Neil, what happened?</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I was walking up a mountain on my own and suddenly a bunch of monkeys jumped out of nowhere, blocking my path.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Oh goodness! OK. So what did you do?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>After standing there for ages while the monkeys screeched at me, I turned round and walked back the way I came.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>OK. If you <strong>screech</strong> at someone it means to make a loud, high and unpleasant sound. So the monkeys won that <strong>face-off</strong>, then!</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Absolutely! Yes, they did! And a face-off, by the way, means an argument or fight.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Well, today\u2019s show is about gibbons and the different sounds they make. <strong>Gibbons</strong> are small apes that live in Southeast Asia. And while Neil\u2019s monkeys screech unpleasantly, gibbons sound like they are singing.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Musical apes \u2013 that\u2019s nice! So how about today\u2019s quiz question, Rob?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>OK, good idea. How far can a gibbon\u2019s voice travel through the forest? Is it\u2026</span></p>, <p><span>a) 500m</span></p>, <p><span>b) 1km</span></p>, <p><span>or c) 5km?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Hmm. Well, I have to guess and I\u2019m going to say b) 1km.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>You\u2019ve never heard one.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Never heard one\u2026</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>OK. We\u2019ll find out later on in the programme whether you\u2019re right or wrong. Now let\u2019s listen to what a gibbon really sounds like.</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Interview with Dr Esther Clarke, researcher at Durham University <br/></strong></span><span><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Let\u2019s just hear this. [gibbons calling] That\u2019s an absolutely wonderful, evocative sound, isn\u2019t it? Beautiful sound. And what are they doing there then? That is \u2026 I said talking to each other. </span></p>, <p><span><strong>Dr Clarke:</strong> Well this is their\u2026 They\u2019re singing together. So a male and a female, when they hold a territory together, will sing every morning what they call a duet. All the groups\u2026</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Interviewer:</strong> What we call a duet.</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Dr Clarke:</strong> Yes, absolutely. And they\u2019ll all sing together at the same time, and the whole forest will be alive with this cacophony of song.</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong></span><span>So the gibbons make an <strong>evocative</strong> sound. If something is evocative it brings strong feelings or memories to mind.</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And something that is evocative is usually pleasant, Rob.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>It is. And what\u2019s also interesting is that the apes are singing in pairs \u2013 one male and one female. They are singing <strong>duets</strong> together. So a duet is a song sung by two people \u2013 or in this case, sung by two gibbons!</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And a lot of gibbons are singing duets at the same time \u2013 which Dr Clarke describes as a <strong>cacophony</strong>. Cacophony means a mix of loud noises, which often sound out of tune.</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And that could easily describe us singing together! </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Let\u2019s not do that.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>But what\u2019s the reason for the gibbon duets, Neil?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, the songs advertise the relationship between the male and the female. And they also help to make clear which <strong>territory</strong> \u2013 or bit of land \u2013 belongs to a pair or group of gibbons.</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Gibbons also use different sounds to <strong>alert</strong> \u2013 or warn \u2013 other gibbons about danger from <strong>predators</strong> \u2013 these are animals that eat other animals. The gibbons use a quiet \u2018hoo hoo\u2019 call to communicate that a leopard is nearby, and an even quieter \u2018hoo hoo\u2019 call for an eagle.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>You\u2019re very good at that Rob. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Thank you.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Now let\u2019s hear more from Dr Clarke about this. How does she describe language?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Dr Esther Clarke, researcher at Durham University</span></strong><br/><span>Yes, so the idea is that if we find things like context-specific calling in non-human primates, it suggests that way back in time the ancestor that we shared with them also had context-specific calling so basically it just gives us some clues [as] to the evolutionary roots of complex communication like language. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Dr Clarke says that if we go far enough back in time humans and other primates such as monkeys and apes have the same <strong>ancestor</strong>. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Right. And ancestor means an animal \u2013 or human \u2013 from the past that a modern animal or human has descended from. So if this common ancestor used <strong>context-specific</strong> calls like modern gibbons \u2013 then it could have passed on this ability to humans a long time ago.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Context-specific calling means different calls for different situations, for example one call for \u2018leopard\u2019 and another for \u2018eagle\u2019.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And <strong>evolutionary</strong> means a gradual process of change or development.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>OK, let\u2019s have the answer to the quiz question. Earlier I asked: How far can a gibbon\u2019s voice travel through the forest? Is it: a) 500m b) 1km or c) 5km?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And I said b) 1km. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>And you were right! A good guess! Perhaps you do know a lot about gibbons. So well done! Now, can we hear today\u2019s words again maybe in a gibbon's voice Neil?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>I\u2019m not sure about that. I\u2019ll do it in a human voice. </span></p>, <p><span>primates</span></p>, <p><span>a close shave</span></p>, <p><span>screech</span></p>, <p><span>face-off</span></p>, <p><span>gibbons</span></p>, <p><span>evocative</span></p>, <p><span>duet</span></p>, <p><span>cacophony</span></p>, <p><span>territory </span></p>, <p><span>alert</span></p>, <p><span>predators</span></p>, <p><span>ancestor</span></p>, <p><span>evolutionary</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Thank you.

Welcome to 6 Minute English. With me today is Neil. Hello, Neil.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Hello Rob!</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>In this programme we're going to be talking about endangered species, particularly elephants in China. So let's start with a question, Neil. Do you know how many elephants are still living in the wild in China? Is it:</p>, <p>a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Fewer than 15,000</p>, <p>b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Fewer than 1,000</p>, <p>c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Fewer than 300</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I don't know but I'm going to have a guess and say b) fewer than 1,000.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>I'll let you know if you're right or wrong at the end of the programme.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So Rob, have you ever come across any animal species under threat?</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes, I have, I went to Australia a few years ago and saw some turtles on the beach laying their eggs and they're very rare, aren't they?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>They are very rare. I've always wanted to see them but I haven't had the chance. \u00a0I was lucky enough to see a panda when I was in China once and they're threatened with extinction, too, of course.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>The sad thing is, Neil, these animals are in danger largely because of the activities of human beings. There are\u00a0all sorts of reasons why this is happening.\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, it's really upsetting. And it could easily be prevented if people thought a bit harder about the impact their lives make on wild animals. Take those sea turtles you were talking about, for instance. They're under threat for all sorts of reasons, over-fishing being one of them.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Then there are various species of rhinoceros which could disappear in a few years' time. Again, people <strong>poach</strong> these creatures \u2013 poach means hunt illegally - because their horns are used for medicinal purposes. And, of course, in country areas, miles from civilisation, it's almost impossible to keep a check on illegal killings.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>It really makes you think, doesn't it Rob?</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Actually, it's not that simple, Neil. Human beings are also under pressure and often have strong arguments in favour of their actions. This Chinese farmer explains. He uses an expression that means \"arrived\". Can you tell me what it is? \u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Chinese farmer\u00a0<br/></strong>There are too many elephants around here. We used to grow sugar cane but then the elephants started showing up and ate it all. So we gave up growing it. There was barely anything we could grow. No matter what we planted there was nothing to harvest \u2026. Now we grow rubber. It's the only thing they won't eat.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>He said \"showing up\". This means the elephants arrived.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And he said they \"gave up\" growing it. This means they stopped growing it.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>The plight of the Asian elephant in China makes a pretty bleak picture, I must say. I understand that they are victims of all sorts of abuse.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes, experts say their numbers have declined by 50 per cent in the last 75 years. Poaching is one reason why. They are hunted not for their tusks \u2013 that happens to the larger African elephant \u2013 but for their skins to make leather goods and for their meat.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>They are also losing their <strong>habitats</strong> \u2013 that's the places where they live - because of the growth in the number of plantations, particularly rubber, but also other cash crops. These agricultural monocultures, as they are called, spell death for the elephants' lifestyle. Logging or deforestation \u2013 in which whole forests are destroyed - also adds to their problems.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>What's more, in some places, their migratory routes have been cut off by human populations living in newly established villages. In a more general sense, just expanding human population is forcing them out of their natural environments.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>There's another very unpleasant way in which these creatures are suffering, Rob. Many of the young elephants are taken away from the herd and are turned into performing circus animals for tourists.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Really, Neil?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, I hear that sometimes nails are driven into their feet, they are deprived of sleep, food and water. This is to make them easy to train.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>That's so cruel.\u00a0 But there are people trying to improve the situation, Neil. For example, there's a <strong>rehabilitation programme</strong> \u2013 that's a scheme to bring them back to a normal life - which rescues elephants at risk and give them protection within a special sanctuary. Then there are some people who are trying to get people to get farmers to work in a different way. Let's listen to a forestry policeman. He uses an expression to describe the way people farm the land. Can you tell me what it is? \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Forestry police representative</strong><br/>It makes me sad. I want people to know that they shouldn't cut down the forest and that there are consequences if they do. I want them to change their farming practices, to change how they make a living. We could become a tourist destination. People could make money from that.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>He said \"farming practices\". This means the way people farm the land.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And he said \"make a living\". This refers to people earning enough money in order to survive. So, let's hope the elephants still living in the wild in China can be saved. So, would you like the answer to the quiz question now?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, OK. You asked me how many elephants are still living in the wild in China. Was it fewer than 15,000, fewer than 1,000, or fewer than 300? And I guessed 1,000.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>I'm afraid the answer is actually fewer than 300.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>That's a real cause for concern.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well, we're almost out of time. So, let's remind ourselves of some of the words we've said today, Neil.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>poach</p>, <p>habitats</p>, <p>showing up</p>, <p>gave up</p>, <p>farming practices</p>, <p>make a living</p>, <p>rehabilitation programme</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well, that's it for today.

Welcome to 6 Minute English. With me today is Neil. Hello, Neil.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>Hello Rob!</p>, <p><strong> Rob<br/> </strong>In this programme we're going to be talking about coffee.</p>, <p><strong> Neil<br/> </strong>Coffee? I've actually got one here in front of me, Rob.</p>, <p><strong> Rob</strong><br/> What kind of coffee are you drinking?</p>, <p><strong> Neil</strong><br/> It's a skinny latte. And what's that that you've got?</p>, <p><strong> Rob</strong><br/> I've gone for a flat white today. (Sound of sipping) Mmm. That tastes good.</p>, <p><strong> Neil</strong><br/> Looks good too! The market for the world's most popular drink has come a long way since the days of instant coffee, when we just added boiling water to some brown powder.</p>, <p><strong> Rob</strong><br/> Yes, that's very true, Neil. After that came the giants like Starbucks and Costa Coffee who made coffee drinking trendy and a lifestyle statement. People are far more aware of what they're drinking these days.</p>, <p><strong> Neil</strong><br/> But Rob, I don't think we should forget what lies behind the coffee we enjoy every day. It's a hugely complicated business.</p>, <p><strong>Rob</strong><br/> Yes, it's the second biggest commodity in the world, after oil. That means the price of coffee is changing every day, every hour even, as traders speculate about the price.</p>, <p><strong>Neil</strong><br/> It means farmers in countries like Ethiopia, Costa Rica and Brazil are dependent on the deals that are made in commodity markets thousands of miles from their farms. It makes them extremely vulnerable.</p>, <p><strong>Rob</strong><br/> Let's listen to food journalist Sheila Dillon as she explains the impact of coffee markets on local growers. She uses an expression that means \"has a big effect\". Can you tell me what it is?</p>, <p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Sheila Dillon, Food Journalist<br/></strong>What happens in the coffee markets <strong>makes waves</strong> around the globe. Entire national economies depend on the price of coffee. It's the key to whether individual farmers can <strong>provide for</strong> their families, face unemployment and ultimately whether whole communities stay on the land or trek to the cities.</p>, <p><strong> Neil</strong><br/> She said \"makes waves\". This means \"have a big effect\".</p>, <p><strong> Rob</strong><br/> She also used the expression \"provide for\" their families. This means the farmer's family have enough income to live comfortably. Good. Right. So what about our quiz question today? Neil do you know many cups of coffee are drunk worldwide each year? Is it:</p>, <p>a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 38 billion</p>, <p>b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 400 billion</p>, <p>c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 950 billion</p>, <p><strong>Neil</strong><br/> Well, it's going to be a huge number, of course. But I still think I'll go for the lowest figure, which is 38 billion.</p>, <p><strong> Rob</strong><br/> Well, we'll see if you got the right answer at the end of the programme.</p>, <p><strong> Neil</strong><br/> Now, the price of coffee has soared \u2013 that means gone up quickly \u2013 in recent years, Rob. Surely that's good for everyone involved in the business? I believe the profit margins for coffee are among the highest in the world. I can't see what all the fuss is about.</p>, <p><strong>Rob</strong><br/> Well, Neil, just because the price is high, it doesn't mean that everyone benefits. It all depends on how the profits are distributed. You see there are countless transactions between the grower and the drinker. A grower can have a really good crop, but the amount he makes stays the same \u2013 or can even fall.</p>, <p><strong> Neil</strong><br/> Mmm, I see the problem. I expect most of the profits go to the commodity traders and very little to the individual growers of the bean. It sounds like the growers have no control. That's what happens in other agricultural sectors.</p>, <p><strong> Rob<br/> </strong>I'm afraid so. Of course, some people are trying to distribute the profits more widely and they have been having some success.</p>, <p><strong> Neil</strong><br/> Yes, I heard about some small-scale projects where the company takes charge of the whole process from field to shop.</p>, <p><strong> Rob</strong><br/> Yes, these organisations tend to farm organically. This is very <strong>labour intensive</strong> \u2013 that means a lot of people are employed \u2013 and it creates a lot of jobs for people within the local community. In this way they are not victims of market fluctuations. Let's listen to Leo Virmani, who runs a small plantation like this in Costa Rica. What's the verb he uses for putting the coffee in a box before selling it?</p>, <p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Leo Virmani, Coffee producer<br/></strong>For our plantation, the approach we have is to go through every step of the way - every step of the process - so that we grow it, we pick it, and we process it in the mill. Then eventually we'll roast it, we'll <strong>package</strong> it, and we'll sell it as the small plantation we are. And that would allow us to stay or be <strong>profitable</strong> at the end of the day.</p>, <p><strong>Neil</strong><br/> So, he used the verb \"package\", which means \"put a product in a packet or box before selling\" it.\u00a0</p>, <p><strong> Rob</strong><br/> And he said his community can stay \"profitable\" \u2013 this means they can always maintain profits \u2013 or make money.</p>, <p><strong> Neil<br/> </strong>Well, it's good to know that small growers can live reasonably comfortably despite what the world markets are doing. The next time I grab a takeaway coffee I'll try to remember all the politics involved in the production process.</p>, <p><strong> Rob<br/> </strong>Yes, me too. So, shall we have the answer to the quiz question now?</p>, <p><strong> Neil</strong><br/> Yes. You asked me how many cups of coffee are drunk worldwide each year \u2013 38 billion, 400 billion or 950 billion. And I guessed 38 billion.</p>, <p><strong> Rob<br/> </strong>I'm afraid you're wrong \u2013 the answer is actually 400 billion.</p>, <p><strong> Neil<br/> </strong>No way.That's incredible.</p>, <p><strong> Rob</strong><br/> Yes, it's an extraordinary statistic. Well, we're almost out of time. So, let's remind ourselves of some of the words we've said today, Neil.</p>, <p><strong> Neil<br/></strong>commodity</p>, <p>speculate</p>, <p>fluctuations</p>, <p>vulnerable</p>, <p>make waves</p>, <p>provides for</p>, <p>labour intensive</p>, <p>package</p>, <p>profitable</p>, <p><strong>Rob</strong><br/> Well, that's it for today.

Not a cloud in the sky! Spring is definitely here! Now, Neil, you\u2019re a bit of a sun worshipper, aren\u2019t you? You like sunbathing\u2026</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I do indeed! I love sitting in my deckchair in the garden, catching some rays\u2026</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Hmm, yes, you look a bit orange actually. Are you sure that tan's not fake? </span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong></span><span>Very cheeky, Rob, very cheeky\u2026</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob</span></strong><br/><span>Now the reason I mentioned sunbathing is because we\u2019re discussing the sun in this programme.</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, that\u2019s right. The sun is our nearest star \u2013 although it\u2019s a staggering 150 million kilometres away. Earth is one of nine planets that <strong>orbit</strong> \u2013 or circle around \u2013 the sun. And life on Earth couldn\u2019t exist without its warmth and light.</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And we should mention\u2026 the sun is absolutely <strong>massive</strong>. Its volume is so large you could fit a million Earths inside it.</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>That\u2019s amazing! It\u2019s also incredibly hot. Hotter than anything you could imagine. </span></p>, <p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>So Neil, can you answer this question: How hot is the surface of the sun? Now I\u2019ll help you out by telling you that the sun\u2019s <strong>core</strong> \u2013 that\u2019s the centre \u2013 is a blistering five million degrees Celsius. But how hot is the sun\u2019s surface? Is it ...</span></p>, <p><span>a) 1.5 billion degrees Celsius</span></p>, <p><span>b) 1.5 million degrees Celsius</span></p>, <p><span>or c) 5500 degrees Celsius</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Hmm. I have no idea. They all sound quite warm to me. But \u2026 I think it must be a bit cooler than the core. So I\u2019m going to go for 1.5 million degrees.</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Okay. Well, we'll find out if you're right or wrong later on. But now let\u2019s listen to Professor of Solar Physics Louise Harra to discover what the sun is made of.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Louise Harra, Professor of Solar Physics at UCL Mullard Space Science<br/></span></strong><span>It\u2019s just a big ball of gas. And we measure it\u2026 it\u2019s made mostly of hydrogen. So it\u2019s roughly 90% hydrogen, it\u2019s maybe 8% helium, and the rest of it\u2019s made up of things like iron, carbon, oxygen, nickel.</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So the main gas is hydrogen, which accounts for 90% of the sun\u2019s <strong>matter</strong>. Now, 'matter' means what something is made of.</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And hydrogen creates all the sun\u2019s <strong>energy</strong>. Heat and light energy is created all the time in the sun\u2019s core as a result of gas explosions or nuclear reactions. And this bit is hard to believe \u2013 it takes a hundred thousand years for this light energy to travel from the sun\u2019s core to the sun\u2019s surface. </span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>But once it reaches the sun\u2019s surface \u2013 the <strong>photosphere</strong> \u2013 it can escape. In fact, it takes only eight minutes for light energy from the sun to reach the Earth. Scientists these days are able to see the photosphere in fantastic detail using powerful telescopes. \u00a0</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Though Galileo observed dark spots on the sun through his telescope several hundred years ago, didn\u2019t he? Which brings us on to another question: How old is the sun? </span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, I happen to know that it came into being around four and a half billion years ago. </span></p>, <p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Did you study solar physics at university, Neil? </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>No, just\u2026 you know, just general knowledge.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Well, the sun <strong>came into being</strong> \u2013 or was created \u2013 a very long time ago! We\u2019re going to hear now from Professor of Physics, Yvonne Elseworth. What does she say about how long the sun is going to stay the same?</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Yvonne Elseworth, Poynting Professor of Physics at the University of Birmingham<br/></strong>In terms of its current lifestyle it\u2019s here for as long again, so we\u2019re about half way through. And then it becomes a different sort of star \u2013 it becomes a giant star and that\u2019s probably curtains for us, actually. It\u2019ll get a bit warm, a bit toasty, and we\u2019ll get enveloped in the sun, and it won\u2019t be nice...</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So the sun is going to stay the same for another four and a half billion years. But the professor also says that the sun will change. When it becomes a giant star, it will be <strong>curtains</strong> for our planet \u2013 and \u2018curtains\u2019 means the end, I\u2019m afraid!</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes, it does. And as a giant star, the sun will get hotter \u2013 it will make the Earth <strong>toasty</strong>. Now, toasty usually means hot in a nice way.</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>That\u2019s right \u2013 for example, my toes are warm and toasty in my new slippers. But in reality the giant sun will make the Earth unbearably hot. It will surround \u2013 or <strong>envelop</strong> \u2013 our planet and burn it up. \u00a0</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob</span></strong><br/><span>Well, I\u2019m glad we\u2019re not going to be around when that happens. Now, remember at the beginning of the show I asked you how hot the sun\u2019s surface is? Is it a) 1.5 billion b) 1.5 million or c) 5500 degrees Celsius?</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I said 1.5 million\u2026</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>It\u2019s way too hot, I\u2019m afraid you were wrong. The answer is actually 5500 degrees Celsius. But still, if you\u2019re planning on visiting the sun, remember to take your sunglasses and plenty of sunscreen!

Welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Neil and with me in the studio today is Harry. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Harry<br/></span></strong><span>Hello!</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>We all have two biological parents but in the future if someone from the UK tells you they have three parents, it might be true. </span></p>, <p><span><strong>Harry<br/></strong>That's right. This is because the UK has become the first country to approve laws allowing the creation of babies with <strong>DNA</strong> from three people! DNA is the chemical structure present in the centre of a cell which defines somebody's characteristics. This is to fight a particular disease.</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes. Sometimes parts of the DNA called <strong>genes</strong> are <strong>faulty</strong>; it means they don't work properly and this might cause problems later on. A new technique will allow some of these genes to be replaced by healthy ones from a third person. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Harry</span></strong><span> <br/>This practice is controversial \u2013 people argue about it. They fear we're going to mess with nature and end up with a Frankenstein's monster!</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Wow, that would be frightening, let's hope it doesn't happen! Well, in this programme we're talking about the three-parent baby and you're going to learn some vocabulary related to reproduction.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Harry<br/></span></strong><span><strong>Genetics</strong> \u2013 the science of how living creatures pass their characteristics to their offspring \u2013 is fascinating, Neil! </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>It is fascinating, and you know what I find most surprising, Harry? It's how much DNA we have in common with other living creatures.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Harry<br/></span></strong><span>I've heard that a very high percentage of our DNA is similar to the DNA of monkeys. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>The comparison with monkeys is easy. Over 95% of our DNA is identical to theirs. But what you might not know is\u2026 how much of our DNA is similar to the DNA in a banana?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Harry<br/></span></strong><span>A banana?!</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yes. And that's my quiz question today. What percentage of our DNA is similar to that of a banana? Is it:</span></p>, <p><span>a)</span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <span>About 1%</span></p>, <p><span>b)</span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <span>About 20% or</span></p>, <p><span>c)</span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <span>About 50%</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Harry<br/></span></strong><span>I think we have very little in common with bananas so I'm gonna go for 1%. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, I'll give you the correct answer at the end of the programme. Now let's talk about the three-parent baby. A <strong>pioneering</strong> technique, in other words, a technique never used before, has been developed by scientists in Newcastle University here in the UK. The technique helps people with faulty <strong>mitochondria</strong>, which are structures that work like energy factories in our cells. The mitochondria are like batteries.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Harry<br/></span></strong><span>And what kind of problems do people who inherit faulty mitochondria have?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>They have serious health problems such as brain damage and heart failure. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Harry<br/></span></strong><span>That's terrible! Maybe it would be good to have this technique approved.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, not everybody agrees with it. Fiona Bruce, who is a Member of Parliament here in Britain, expressed concern when the proposal was discussed in Parliament. Listen out for the expression she uses right at the beginning of her speech. It means that when you start something, you can't take it back.</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Fiona Bruce MP<br/></strong>Once <strong>the genie is out of the bottle</strong>, once these procedures that we are being asked to authorise today go ahead, there will be no going back for society. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Harry<br/></span></strong><span>She says that <strong>the genie is out of the bottle</strong>. It's an expression to do with fairy tales \u2013 in particular, the story of Aladdin, when he rubs a lamp and a genie appears. When the genie is released, anything is possible \u2013 even bad things. And there's nothing anyone can do to stop it.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>So in the case of DNA engineering, people are afraid that similar techniques might be used to create <strong>designer babies</strong> \u2013 babies whose characteristics like height, sex, hair and eye colour are created to order. Or we might be looking at babies with several parents - and who knows where it might end.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Harry<br/></span></strong><span>But the approval of this proposal has also made many people happy,</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, people like Victoria, a mother who has a sick child because of faulty mitochondria. She uses an expression which means 'amazing or astonishing'. Which expression is it?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Victoria Holliday, mother who will benefit from the new technique<br/></span></strong><span>It's just <strong>mind-boggling</strong> what this could mean for our family and for other families who are affected. It's just the best news!</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Harry<br/></span></strong><span>She uses the expression 'mind-boggling', in other words something astonishing, overwhelming. That's great news for this lady. I'm happy for her.</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, it is. According to statistics faulty mitochondria affects one in every 6,500 babies - a considerable number of people. Well, this is an interesting subject but we're running out of time and\u2026</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Harry<br/></span></strong><span>\u2026 and you're going to tell me what percentage of DNA we have in common with a banana, aren't you? </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>I am. And the options I gave you were about 1%, 20% or 50%. And you said\u2026</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Harry<br/></strong>I said I thought it was just 1%. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, can you believe that it's 50%? We are half\u2026 half and half like bananas.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Harry<br/></span></strong><span>That's incredible! They're not even mammals, we are so different to them \u2026 It's mind-boggling! </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Let's listen to today's words once again, Harry.</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Harry<br/></strong>Yes. They were:</span></p>, <p><span>DNA</span></p>, <p><span>genes</span></p>, <p><span>faulty</span></p>, <p><span>genetics</span></p>, <p><span>pioneering</span></p>, <p><span>mitochondria (the singular is irregular: mitochondrion)</span></p>, <p><span>the genie is out of the bottle</span></p>, <p><span>designer babies</span></p>, <p><span>mind-boggling</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, that's it for today.

I'm Neil\u2026</p>, <p><strong>Harry<br/></strong>And I'm Harry.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Now Harry, have you ever taken a '<strong>selfie</strong>' \u2013 that's a photo of yourself, usually with your mobile phone?</p>, <p><strong>Harry<br/></strong>Yes, I have. I've taken them all over London with my children \u2013 of course selfies are very easy to take with your smartphone and recently we've seen some famous selfies featuring well-known people such as the one taken by actor, Ellen DeGeneres at last year's Oscars ceremony.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, it seems that there are no limits to the places where you can <strong>capture</strong> yourself in a photo. But there is a limit on how far you can stretch your arm out and take <strong>a snap</strong> \u2013 a quick photo \u2013 of you and your friends.</p>, <p><strong>Harry<br/></strong>That's true, so thank goodness for the <strong>selfie stick</strong> \u2013 an expanding pole to put your smartphone on which gives you a wider view. This means you can take in more of the background. Sounds like a good idea.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>It does, but it's also causing a problem in some places around the world. More on that in a moment but let's not forget I have a question to ask you Harry.</p>, <p><strong>Harry<br/></strong>OK Neil.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, we know some people love to take photos of themselves but perhaps not as much as Patrick Peterson. According to Guinness World Records he has taken the most 'selfies' in one hour \u2013 but do you know how many? Is it:</p>, <p>a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 449</p>, <p>b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1,449</p>, <p>c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2,449</p>, <p><strong>Harry<br/></strong>Well, I guess he's gotta move and be in a different position so I'm not going to go for the highest one. I'm gonna say1,449.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>OK, well, we'll find out the answer at the end of the programme. But now let's talk more about the dangers of the selfie stick! They can certainly be useful for taking photos from a different <strong>viewpoint</strong> and it does mean that you get more people in your photo.</p>, <p><strong>Harry<br/></strong>Sales of the selfie stick have <strong>soared</strong> \u2013 or risen quickly - since last year and they are now a common sight at tourist destinations. They're great if you want to take a better photo but they're very annoying if you're not involved with the photo.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes and this is particularly frustrating if you're trying to look at paintings and sculptures at an art gallery. They just get in the way and can be very <strong>distracting</strong>.</p>, <p><strong>Harry<br/></strong>You mean they stop someone giving their full attention to what they are looking at. Well, this is the reason that some famous art galleries around the world are putting <strong>a ban</strong> on selfie-sticks \u2013 a ban means they are no longer allowed.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Places such as the Smithsonian museums in Washington and the Palace of Versailles in Paris were the first to do this and now the National Gallery in London have stopped them being used.</p>, <p><strong>Harry<br/></strong>Let's hear the exact reasons why from the gallery's Doctor Susan Foister. What phrase does she use to mean trying to do the best thing for the visitors and for the paintings themselves?</p>, <p><strong>Doctor Susan Foister, Deputy Director, The National Gallery<br/></strong>We have over 6 million visitors a year here, some of our rooms could get quite crowded, so we have to find the right balance between the experience of our visitors close to the paintings and the safety of the paintings themselves.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So the National Gallery is a popular and busy place and it gets quite crowded \u2013 and it doesn't help the problem if people are holding up selfie sticks!</p>, <p><strong>Harry<br/></strong>Yes \u2013 so they have <strong>imposed</strong> \u2013 or brought in \u2013 this ban to do the best thing for the visitors and for the paintings themselves \u2013 it's what Doctor Foister called 'the right balance'. She wants to give visitors trying to get close to the paintings a good experience.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And she makes the point that there's a risk that the painting, which can be worth millions of pounds, could be damaged by one of these sticks.</p>, <p><strong>Harry<br/></strong>Of course you are still allowed to take a selfie, and some museums are <strong>'sticking their neck out'</strong> and still allowing people to use them.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>A good idiom there Harry \u2013 you mean they're doing something that other people may not like \u2013 yes, places such as the ICA \u2013 that's the Institute for Contemporary Art \u2013 in London say selfie sticks are part of modern-day life.</p>, <p><strong>Harry<br/></strong>Here is Catherine Stout, Head of Programmes at the ICA. How does she describe the type of visitors who go to her gallery?</p>, <p><strong>Catherine Stout, Head of Programmes, ICA<br/></strong>We are very happy for our visitors to take their own photographs for personal use, of course we always secure the artist's permission, but actually because we have a very young audience they're completely engaged with social media, they want to use that forum to connect with each other, to share their experiences, if they wish to use a stick they're very welcome to do so as long as, obviously, the artwork is not damaged in any way.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So the people who visit that gallery are young and use social media a lot \u2013 they are '<strong>engaged</strong>' with it and they like to share their experiences. This means taking photos on their smartphones and if they want to use a selfie stick?</p>, <p><strong>Harry<br/></strong>\u2026 then they are 'welcome to do so'. Just watch out where you stick it! I suppose, as long as you respect other visitors and don't get in the way, then it's ok to use one.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well I'm not so sure. Anyway, it's time to reveal the answer to the question I asked you earlier.</p>, <p><strong>Harry<br/></strong>Yes, this was about Patrick Peterson, who holds the record for taking the most selfies in one hour. You asked me if he took 449, 1,449 or 2,449 in one hour.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And you said 1,449, which was \u2026 the correct answer! I wonder what he did with all those images\u2026</p>, <p><strong>Harry<br/></strong>He probably put them on social media.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well we need to 'stick' to our six minutes of English but just before we run out of time, could you remind us of some of the vocabulary we've used today Harry?</p>, <p><strong>Harry<br/></strong>Yes. We had\u2026</p>, <p>selfie</p>, <p>capture</p>, <p>a snap</p>, <p>selfie stick</p>, <p>viewpoint</p>, <p>soared</p>, <p>distracting</p>, <p>a ban</p>, <p>imposed</p>, <p>sticking their neck out</p>, <p>engaged</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Thank you.

I'm Neil and with me in the studio is Harry. Hello, Harry.</p>, <p><strong>Harry<br/></strong>Hello.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Now, Harry, do you have many passwords?</p>, <p><strong>Harry<br/></strong><strong>Passwords</strong> - you mean the set of words and numbers which I keep secret and allow me to access information? Yes, I do actually. I've got a few for my computer and the different websites I use, and then there are my cards \u2013 credit card, debit card. And there's one for my ID here at the BBC and then there is\u2026</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>OK. I get the idea. There are too many, aren't there?</p>, <p><strong>Harry<br/></strong>Oh, yes! Sometimes I struggle to remember them all. And we are advised to learn them<strong> by heart</strong>, in other words, to have them memorised and not written down. \u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>It's for security reasons. If you write them down and lose the paper you wrote them on, then they won't be secret anymore, will they? Now, how would you like to have access to things with no need for passwords or cards?\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Harry<br/></strong>Yeah, that would be brilliant!</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>In this programme, I'm going to tell you about a futuristic commercial building in Stockholm, Sweden, where you don't have to remember any passwords, you don't have to carry ID cards and in some cases, you don't even need to carry money to pay for your coffee.</p>, <p><strong>Harry<br/></strong>How does it all work then - by magic?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>No, by inserting a <strong>microchip</strong> under the skin of your hand! A microchip is a very small device with an electronic circuit which can do particular things. In this case, the microchip we're talking about can identify you.</p>, <p><strong>Harry<br/></strong>Wow! I'm not sure I'd want a microchip inserted under my skin.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>No, me neither. It's interesting though, isn't it? Before I tell you about this experiment, let's go for our quiz question. And, of course, it's about passwords.\u00a0 Security firm SplashData publishes an annual report about the weakest passwords people use. Well, which was the most common password used in 2014. Was it:</p>, <p>a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 abc123</p>, <p>b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the numbers 123456</p>, <p>c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the words 'trustno' followed by the number 1</p>, <p><strong>Harry<br/></strong>I'm going to go for C, 'trustno' followed by the 1, because actually it's the only one I hadn't heard of, even though it's very obvious.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, all will be revealed at the end of the programme. Now we are talking about the increasing need for ID in a society which works more and more with computers - and you'll learn some related vocabulary.</p>, <p><strong>Harry<br/></strong>Tell us more about this building in Sweden, Neil. You have this microchip put under your skin - and what does it allow you to do inside the building?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Let's listen to the BBC technology reporter Rory Cellan-Jones. He went there for a visit. He uses an expression to say that the technology is not working perfectly yet because it is brand new. What is that expression?</p>, <p><strong>Rory Cellan-Jones, BBC technology reporter<br/></strong>The new offices will soon host a shifting population of 700 entrepreneurs and employees and they'll all be offered the chance to 'get chipped' if they wish. As well as opening doors that will allow them to use the photocopiers and eventually to log on to computers or pay for food in the cafe. The technology is still <strong>having</strong> <strong>teething problems</strong> \u2013 I found it quite a struggle to activate the photocopier! And amongst the people working here I found some enthusiasm but also <strong>caution</strong>.</p>, <p><strong>Harry<br/></strong>The expression is 'having teething problems'. When a new project or device doesn't work perfectly we say it 'has teething problems'.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, the microchip allowed Rory to make the photocopier work just by swiping his hand over a console. But it didn't work straight away.</p>, <p><strong>Harry<br/></strong>And he tells us that some of the workers are reacting with <strong>caution</strong> to the idea of having a microchip put under their skin. 'Caution' means being careful to avoid something dangerous or risky.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>It might be risky but we might all be using it one day - who knows? The group running this scheme thinks this might be a good thing. Hannes Sjobland from a Swedish bio-hacking group seems to believe that linking biology and electronic devices can make our daily lives better - but he is concerned about people's freedom. And what if a government or a big corporation wants to use this technology in the future? What does Hannes Sjobland want to be able to do if it happens? A tip, the word is a verb\u2026</p>, <p><strong>Hannes Sjoband, Swedish bio-hacking group<br/></strong>We are early adopters of this technology, we experiment with it, we learn it, how it works, because I think that there might be a day when the taxman or the big corporates \u2026 they will come and say 'hey, try this chip, try this implant', and then we will be able <strong>to question</strong> their proposals.</p>, <p><strong>Harry<br/></strong>He wants to question their proposals; it means to express doubts about their proposals and intentions. You know what, Neil? I'd rather have my passwords!</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, talking about passwords, let's go back to my quiz question. I asked you what the weakest passwords people use is, according to the 2014 report by the online security firm SplashData. The options were: abc123, the numbers 123456 and the words 'trustno' followed by the number 1.</p>, <p><strong>Harry<br/></strong>And I said the third one, 'trustno1'.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And you were\u2026 wrong I'm afraid Harry. The correct answer is B. The password '123456' has been named as the worst password of 2014. The other two were also in the list. Before we go, can you remind us of the words we heard today, Harry.</p>, <p><strong>Harry<br/></strong>The words were:</p>, <p>password</p>, <p>by heart</p>, <p>microchip</p>, <p>having teething problems</p>, <p>caution</p>, <p>to question</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Thank you.

Hello, Mike. </span></p>, <p class=\"Default\"><span><strong>Mike<br/></strong></span><span>Hello.\u00a0 </span></p>, <p class=\"Default\"><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Now, today we're talking about someone you might have read about in history books: Winston Churchill \u2013 the British Prime Minister during the Second World War who is well-known throughout the world. </span></p>, <p class=\"Default\"><span><strong>Winston Churchill, British prime minister 1940-1945 and 1951-1955<br/></strong>We shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets. We shall fight in the hills. We shall never <strong>surrender</strong>!</span></p>, <p class=\"Default\"><strong><span>Mike<br/></span></strong><span>Ah, never surrender, in other words, never submit to your enemy. I remember reading about this speech that Churchill gave in June 1940, when France was being invaded by the forces of Nazi Germany. </span></p>, <p class=\"Default\"><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, and this shows the spirit of this very famous leader still admired to this day. So much so that here in the UK we are marking the 50th anniversary of Winston Churchill's death. \u00a0</span></p>, <p class=\"Default\"><strong><span>Mike<br/></span></strong><span>He was a <strong>controversial</strong> figure wasn't he, Neil? Controversial \u2013 it means people have divided opinion about him. </span></p>, <p class=\"Default\"><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes he was quite a controversial figure. You'll learn more about him in this programme as well as some new words. But first, as ever, I'd like to ask you a quiz question, Mike.</span></p>, <p class=\"Default\"><span><strong>Mike<br/></strong>OK, I'm ready! </span></p>, <p class=\"Default\"><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Do you know a lot about Churchill?</span></p>, <p class=\"Default\"><span><strong>Mike<br/></strong></span><span>I think I do, yes. </span></p>, <p class=\"Default\"><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong></span><span>OK. We'll see about that. Which of these facts about Winston Churchill is false? Now, is it:</span></p>, <p class=\"Default\"><span>a)</span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<span>He won the Nobel Peace Prize.</span></p>, <p class=\"Default\"><span>b)</span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <span>He tried three times before passing exams to the Military Academy.</span></p>, <p class=\"Default\"><span>c)</span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <span>He was a writer and a painter.</span></p>, <p class=\"Default\"><span><strong>Mike <br/></strong>I think it's (a). I think he won a Nobel Prize but I think it was Literature, not Peace.</span></p>, <p class=\"Default\"><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong></span><span>Well, we'll see at the end of the programme. Now, let's talk about Churchill. </span></p>, <p class=\"Default\"><span data-mce-mark=\"1\"><strong>Mike<br/></strong></span><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">You know what, Neil, many people think Churchill has a lot to teach some of today's politicians. He was very <strong>determined</strong>, in other words, he was persistent. When Churchill believed in an idea, he didn't give up easily. \u00a0\u00a0</span></p>, <p class=\"Default\"><span data-mce-mark=\"1\"><strong>Neil<br/></strong></span><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">Yes. The Mayor of London Boris Johnson sees another good quality in Britain's wartime leader. He says there's one thing today's politicians do that Churchill didn't. What was it? How did he deal with issues? </span></p>, <p class=\"Default\"><span data-mce-mark=\"1\"><strong>Boris Johnson, Mayor of London<br/></strong></span><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">It's an illusion to think that he was a guy who <strong>skated over</strong> the issues. He was deeply immersed in all the detail and all the technicality and that helped him to get the right answer. </span></p>, <p class=\"Default\"><span data-mce-mark=\"1\"><strong>Mike<br/></strong>Ah, Churchill didn't 'skate over' the issues. 'To skate over' means to avoid dealing with something. Churchill studied the issues in detail\u2026</span></p>, <p class=\"Default\"><span data-mce-mark=\"1\"><strong>Neil<br/></strong>\u2026 and it helped him to get things right, according to Boris Johnson. One example is that Churchill actually went to Germany in the 1930s to assess the situation in the country first hand. </span></p>, <p class=\"Default\"><span><strong>Mike<br/></strong></span><span>Well, Nazi Germany was defeated and Churchill had a role in that. But there were other things he got wrong. He <strong>misjudged</strong> many situations. Misjudged, in other words, he formed a wrong opinion about them.</span></p>, <p class=\"Default\"><span data-mce-mark=\"1\"><strong>Neil<br/></strong>That's right! The historian Nigel Knight, a leading academic at Cambridge University, wrote a book about Churchill. He lists some of the mistakes made by the wartime leader throughout his political career. Now, let's listen. How does he describe Churchill's character? </span></p>, <p class=\"Default\"><span><strong>Dr Nigel Knight, author: \"Churchill: The Greatest Briton Unmasked\"<br/></strong></span>Churchill was fundamentally <strong>flawed</strong>. So was his military<strong> strategy</strong>: Gallipoli in World War One, which was replicated in the Norwegian, North African and the soft underbelly of Europe campaigns during the World War Two. It was his economic strategy as chancellor in the 1920s, the return to the gold standards, his attitude towards India and the Indians, and indeed his post war 51-55 ministry, which was very <strong>lacklustre </strong>and very poor indeed.</p>, <p class=\"Default\"><span data-mce-mark=\"1\"><strong>Mike<br/></strong></span><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">Nigel Knight calls Churchill 'flawed', it means he had a weakness in his character. And Churchill didn't get it right all the time. </span></p>, <p class=\"Default\"><span data-mce-mark=\"1\"><strong>Neil<br/></strong></span><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">No. He occupied different posts in government and sometimes he didn't get his strategy, which means his plan of action, right. His strategy in some military campaigns ended up in disaster. </span></p>, <p class=\"Default\"><span><strong>Mike<br/></strong></span><span>And his strategy regarding the British economy may have actually contributed to a period of economic crisis known as the Great Depression. And when he became prime minister again, in the 50s, his government wasn't very good, was it Neil?</span></p>, <p class=\"Default\"><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong></span><span>No. Not according to the Cambridge academic Dr Nigel Knight. He called it 'lacklustre', which means dull, uninspiring. </span></p>, <p class=\"Default\"><span data-mce-mark=\"1\"><strong>Mike<br/></strong></span><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">Well, we shall remember him mostly for his speeches in World War Two. </span></p>, <p class=\"Default\"><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, we're running out of time so I'll go back to our quiz question.</p>, <p class=\"Default\"><strong><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">Mike<br/></span></strong><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">You mentioned three facts about Winston Churchill and you said one of them was false, Neil. </span></p>, <p class=\"Default\"><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, and the options were: <br/></span><span><br/>a)</span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<span>He won the Nobel Peace Prize.</span></p>, <p class=\"Default\"><span>b)</span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <span>He tried three times before passing exams to the Military Academy.</span></p>, <p class=\"Default\"><span>c)</span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <span>He was a writer and a painter.</span></p>, <p class=\"Default\"><span><strong>Mike<br/></strong></span><span>And I said I thought he won the Nobel Literature Prize, not the Peace Prize.</span></p>, <p class=\"Default\"><span data-mce-mark=\"1\"><strong>Neil<br/></strong></span><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">And you were absolutely right! Churchill did win a Nobel Prize but it was for Literature because he wrote books about history. He was also a possible candidate for the 1945 Nobel Peace Prize but didn't win. Well, that's it for this programme but let's just remind ourselves of some of the words we've used today. </span></p>, <p class=\"Default\"><span data-mce-mark=\"1\"><strong>Mike <br/></strong></span><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">They were:</span></p>, <p class=\"Default\"><span>surrender</span></p>, <p class=\"Default\"><span>controversial</span></p>, <p class=\"Default\"><span>determined</span></p>, <p class=\"Default\"><span>skate over</span></p>, <p class=\"Default\"><span>misjudged</span></p>, <p class=\"Default\"><span>flawed</span></p>, <p class=\"Default\"><span>strategy</span></p>, <p class=\"Default\"><span>lacklustre</span></p>, <p class=\"Default\"><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Thanks, Mike.

Welcome to 6 Minute English. With me today is Harry. Hello, Harry.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Harry<br/></span></strong><span>Hello, Rob!</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well, in this programme we're talking about wealth. The world is getting richer, Harry. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Harry<br/></span></strong><span>Really? How come? </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Well, according to recent data, the number of people living in extreme poverty has halved in recent decades. More people own a car and a mobile phone. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Harry<br/></span></strong><span>So, that's all very good news. More people can have a good <strong>standard of living</strong> \u2013 standard of living is what we call the amount of money and quality of life people have in a particular society.</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>People in general may have a better life but there's still a lot of inequality in different countries. <strong>Inequality</strong> - in other words some people have a lot of money and opportunities and others just don't.\u00a0 </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Harry<br/></span></strong><span>So, individual governments have to find a way of reducing this inequality, to allow more people to have the opportunity to improve their lives.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Yes. In this programme we're talking about the gap between rich and poor and you'll learn some words which will help you discuss this topic or read about it in the news. And now our quiz, Harry.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Harry<br/></span></strong><span>Ah, the legendary quiz! I'm ready!</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Good. Right. A recent report by Oxfam and Credit Suisse revealed how divided we all are when it comes to wealth. A lot of the wealth in the world is in the hands of very few people. That's what I'm going to ask you about, Harry. How much of the global wealth is owned by the richest 1%? Is it:</span></p>, <p><span>a)</span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <span>38%</span></p>, <p><span>b)</span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <span>48% or</span></p>, <p><span>c)</span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <span>58%</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Harry<br/></span></strong><span>Well, it's only 1% of the population, so I would have to guess the lower one, 38%. Surely they can't own more than that!</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Well, we'll see if you got the right answer at the end of the programme. Now, let's talk about rich and poor. As we said, experts have concluded that more people are living better when you look at the world as a whole, but in individual countries you can find people with hardly anything to eat\u2026</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Harry<br/></span></strong><span>\u2026and others with lots of houses, cars, land and so on\u2026 So, Rob, how can this situation be reversed?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Well, David Bryer from Oxfam mentions a country which has achieved some success in trying to make the poor less poor. He is talking about Brazil. Listen to what Bryer says and tell me: what are the two words he uses meaning 'the least money people are paid for the work they do'?</span></p>, <p><strong>David Bryer from Oxfam<br/></strong>There are examples we can look to where countries are managing to reduce the gap between the super-rich and the rest. Brazil has historically very high levels of economic inequality. And they've been taking just some really sensible measures \u2013 measures around having more progressive <strong>tax</strong>, around investing in a higher <strong>minimum wage</strong>, investing in central public services, you know, these things that all governments can do that start to reverse this tide.</p>, <p><strong><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">Harry<br/></span></strong><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">So David Bryer talks about a 'minimum wage'. That's the least a worker receives in payment for work they've done. He meant that if people are paid a higher minimum wage, they can eat better, seek a better education, and their children can have a better job in the future. They can be lifted out of poverty.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>And the economy can grow. More people with more money buy more things and factories produce more. A factory which produces more will need more workers. So, more jobs for all. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Harry<br/></span></strong><span>Right. Another measure by the Brazilian government which is mentioned by the representative from Oxfam has to do with tax. Tax is the amount of money you pay to the government depending on your salary and the cost of things you buy\u2026 But we have to admit this, Rob: taxes are not popular.</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>That's true. Many people don't like paying tax because they don't receive an immediate benefit from it. Some very rich people try to pay as little as possible. But one billionaire who thinks it's important to pay and create conditions for governments to fight poverty is Bill Gates. The founder of Microsoft earned a lot of money, retired and, with his wife Melinda, created a foundation to help the poor. The BBC asked him what the very rich have to do to help reduce poverty. Let's listen to his answer. What does he say rich people have to be? The word is an adjective.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Bill Gates, philanthropist<br/></span></strong>Well, their obligation of course is to pay their taxes, but our advice to them is that they all look at taking their wealth and being <strong>philanthropic</strong> - both in their own country and to help the global poorest. That's a full-time work Melinda and I do, we find it very <strong>fulfilling</strong>, we love seeing the progress.</p>, <p><span><strong>Harry<br/></strong>So rich people have to be 'philanthropic'! It means they have to help poor people by giving their money. </span></p>, <p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong></span><span>And he says he and his wife find this giving to the poor 'fulfilling', in other words, it makes them happy and satisfied. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Harry<br/></span></strong><span>Well, that's his message to the very, very, very, very rich in the world! To the\u2026 1%!</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>The 1%...Well, you want the answer to my quiz question now, don't you?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Harry<br/></span></strong><span>Yes. You asked me how much of the global wealth is owned by the richest 1% of the world's population. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>And the options I gave you were: 38%, 48% or 58%</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Harry<br/></span></strong><span>And I guessed 38% based on the fact that I couldn't imagine them earning more than that.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>I like your thinking, Harry, but I'm afraid the correct answer is actually (b) 48%. The wealthiest 1% will soon own more than the rest of the world's population \u2013 that's according to a study by anti-poverty charity Oxfam.</span>\u00a0</p>, <p><strong><span>Harry<br/></span></strong><span>I think it's truly shocking that such a small number of people can own so much.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>You're right. It's an amazing statistic. OK, well, we're almost out of time but let's remind ourselves of some of the words that we've said today, Harry.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Harry<br/></span></strong><span>standard of living</span></p>, <p><span>inequality</span></p>, <p><span>minimum wage</span></p>, <p><span>tax</span></p>, <p><span>philanthropic</span></p>, <p><span>fulfilling</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well, that's it for today.

The price of life-saving vaccines has escalated \u2013 has gone up - and some of the world\u2019s poorer countries are struggling <strong>to immunise</strong> children \u2013 to immunise, in other words, to prevent children from catching diseases.</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, the organisation Medecins Sans Frontieres is criticising the pharmaceutical companies which produce the vaccines. Medecins Sans Frontieres is a well-known <strong>charity </strong>\u2013 a charity is an organisation set up to help and raise money for people in need. </span></p>, <p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>We\u2019re going to talk about the cost of vaccines and you\u2019ll learn some words you can use to discuss the topic yourself or to follow the news. But first, a question, Neil.</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob</span></strong><span> <br/>The first laboratory-developed vaccine was produced in 1879. The vaccine was against an animal disease called chicken cholera. Who was the scientist behind it? Was it\u2026</span></p>, <p><span>a) Alexander Fleming</span></p>, <p><span>b) Albert Sabin</span></p>, <p><span>c) Louis Pasteur</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, I don\u2019t know, but I\u2019m going to guess. Probably not (a) because Fleming discovered penicillin. Probably not (c) because Pasteur did pasteurisation. I\u2019m gonna go for (b).</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>OK. It sounds like you know your vaccines. Well, we'll have the answer to that question at the end of the programme. Now, let\u2019s talk about the controversy behind these life-saving vaccines. On one side we have a charity and on the other side, the drug companies.</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Which vaccines are they talking about? </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Well, they\u2019re talking about vaccines which prevent diseases such as tuberculosis, measles, diphtheria and polio. According to Medecins Sans Frontieres, between 2001 and 2014 there was a 68-fold increase in vaccine prices. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, that is a lot!</span></p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>It certainly is. And the group says that there are particular cases in which rich western countries are actually getting vaccines at a cheaper rate than poorer countries. That\u2019s what Medecins Sans Frontieres says, and they\u2019re asking for more transparency around prices.</p>, <p><strong><span data-mce-mark=\"1\">Neil<br/></span></strong><span data-mce-mark=\"1\"><strong>Transparency</strong> means clarity, something done in an open way, without secrets.</span></p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes, they want to know the cost of the vaccines. Let\u2019s hear what Rohit Malpani from Medecins Sans Frontieres has to say. See if you can spot the expression Malpani uses to describe how high the price of the vaccine is for some countries.\u00a0</p>, <p><strong><span>Rohit Malpani, from Medecins Sans Frontieres<br/></span></strong><em><span>This is all a black box. It\u2019s a black box in terms of the price they are charging to most countries around the world so they\u2019re often charging prices that are wildly <strong>out of proportion</strong> with their ability to pay. You have Morocco and Tunisia that now are paying higher prices than France for the pneumococcal\u00a0vaccine. We also simply do not know the cost of production and if GlaxoSmithKline says that it costs more than we are saying it does, then they should simply submit to some sort of audit to ensure that we can <strong>verify</strong> the cost of production. </span></em></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>The expression which describes the relationship between the price asked and the ability to pay is \u2018out of proportion\u2019. It means it\u2019s unrealistic or exaggerated.</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And Malpani from Medecins Sans Frontieres says that Morocco and Tunisia are paying more than France \u2013 a much richer country \u2013 for a particular vaccine. </span></p>, <p><span data-mce-mark=\"1\"><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And his organisation wants transparency. They want to be able <strong>to verify </strong>the cost of production. To verify means to confirm that something is really true and they want the drug company to confirm that the cost to produce the vaccines is really as high as they say it is.</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong></span><span>Well, at this point, we have to hear what the companies say.</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, because they argue that they already sell these vaccines at a <strong>discount</strong>, in other words, at a reduced price.</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes, they do. GlaxoSmithKline says that around 80% of all their vaccines, including the one mentioned by Malpani, are provided to developing countries at a substantial discount. And the company adds that the pneumococcal vaccine is one of the most complex they\u2019ve ever manufactured because it combines 10 vaccines in one. </span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes. On one hand, vaccines take many years of research and these companies want <strong>to make a profit</strong>, which means to sell the product for more than it costs to make it.</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>But on the other hand, the lack of vaccines can kill people and it\u2019s really very sad to see people dying of diseases which can be prevented. Some vaccines may be very affordable for a person in a rich country\u2026</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>\u2026 but they might cost a fortune to someone in a poor country.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>This is a very complex problem and I\u2019m sure we will talk about this again in the future. But now, let\u2019s go back to the quiz question, Neil.</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>You asked about the first vaccine developed in a laboratory\u2026</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, I did. The first laboratory-developed vaccine was produced in 1879. It was a vaccine for the animal disease called chicken cholera. I wanted to know the name of the scientist who developed it. Was it Alexander Fleming, Albert Sabin or Louis Pasteur?</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I said (b) Albert Sabin.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>And you were wrong! The correct answer is (C) Louis Pasteur, who was a French microbiologist. Now, Neil, the option you chose, the American scientist Albert Sabin, in fact developed an oral vaccine against polio in the 1950s \u2013 still very useful. And Alexander Fleming from Scotland did indeed discover penicillin, as you said.</p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, that is interesting and I\u2019m a bit disappointed that I got it wrong actually.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Okay.

Welcome to 6 Minute English and with me in the studio is Neil.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Hello, Rob. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Hello. Feeling bright today, Neil?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>I am feeling quite bright and clever, yes!</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>That\u2019s good to hear. Well, <strong>you\u2019ll need all your wits about you</strong> \u2013 meaning you\u2019ll need to think very quickly in this programme because we\u2019re talking about intelligence, or to be more accurate, <strong>Artificial </strong>Intelligence. And we\u2019ll learn some vocabulary related to the topic so that you can have your own discussion about it. Now, Neil, you know who Professor Stephen Hawking is, right?</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, of course! Yes. Many people say that he\u2019s a <strong>genius</strong> \u2013 in other words, he is very, very intelligent. Professor Hawking is one of the most famous scientists in the world and people remember him for his brilliance and also because he communicates using a <strong>synthetic</strong> voice generated by a computer \u2013 synthetic means it\u2019s made from something non-natural. Artificial is similar in meaning \u2013 we use it when something is man-made to look or behave like something natural. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Well, Professor Hawking has said recently that efforts to create thinking machines are a threat to our existence. A <strong>threat</strong> means something which can put us in danger. Now, can you imagine that, Neil?!</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, there\u2019s no denying that good things can come from the creation of Artificial Intelligence. Computers which can think for themselves might be able to find solutions to problems we haven\u2019t been able to solve. But technology is developing quickly and maybe we should consider the consequences. Some of these very clever robots are already surpassing us, Rob. <strong>To surpass</strong> means to have abilities superior to our own.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Yes. Maybe you can remember the headlines when a supercomputer defeated the World Chess Champion Gary Kasparov, to everybody\u2019s astonishment. It was in 1997. What was the computer called, Neil? Was it:</span></p>, <p><span>a)</span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <span>Red Menace</span></p>, <p><span>b)</span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <span>Deep Blue</span></p>, <p><span>c)</span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <span>Silver Surfer</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I don\u2019t know. I think (c) is probably not right. I think Deep Blue. That\u2019s (b) Deep Blue.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Okay. You\u2019ll know if you got it right at the end of the programme. Well, our theme is Artificial Intelligence and when we talk about this we have to mention the movies. </span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Many science fiction movies have explored the idea of bad computers who want to harm us. One example is 2001: A Space Odyssey. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, a good film. And another is The Terminator, a movie in which actor Arnold Schwarzenegger played an <strong>android</strong> from the future. An android is a robot that looks like a human. Have you watched that one, Neil?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, I have. And the android is not very friendly. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>No, it\u2019s not. In many movies and books about robots that think, the robots end up rebelling against their creators. But some experts say the risk posed by Artificial Intelligence is not that computers attack us because they hate us. Their problem is related to their efficiency. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>What do you mean?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Well, let\u2019s listen to what philosopher Nick Bostrom has to say. He is the founder of the Future of Humanity Institute at Oxford University. He uses three words when describing what\u2019s inside the mind of a thinking computer. This phrase means \u2018to meet their objectives\u2019. What\u2019s the phrase he uses?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Nick Bostrom, philosopher, Future of Humanity Institute at Oxford University<br/></span></strong>The bulk of the risk is not in machines being evil or hating humans but rather that they are indifferent to humans and that in <strong>pursuit </strong>of <strong>their </strong>own <strong>goals</strong> we humans would suffer as a side effect. Suppose you had a super intelligent AI whose only goal was to make as many paperclips as possible. Human bodies consist of <strong>atoms </strong>and those atoms could be used to make a lot of really nice paperclips. If you want paperclips it turns out that in the pursuit of this you would have instrumental reasons to do things that would be horrible to humanity.</p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>A world in which humans become paperclips - wow, that\u2019s scary! But the phrase which means \u2018meet their objectives\u2019 is to \u2018pursue their goals\u2019.</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes, it is. So the academic explains that if you\u2019re a computer responsible for producing paperclips, you will pursue your objective at any cost\u2026 </span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>\u2026 and even use atoms from human bodies to turn them into paperclips! Now that\u2019s a horror story, Rob. If Stephen Hawking is worried, I think I might be too. How can we be sure that Artificial Intelligence \u2013 be it either a device or software \u2013 will have a <strong>moral compass</strong>? </span></p>, <p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Ah, a good expression - a moral compass - in other words, an understanding of what is right and what is wrong.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Artificial Intelligence is an interesting topic, Rob. I hope we can chat about it again in the future. But now I\u2019m looking at the clock and we are running out of time, I\u2019m afraid, and I\u2019d like to know if I got the answer to the quiz question right?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Well, my question was about a supercomputer which defeated the World Chess Champion Gary Kasparov in 1997. What was the machine\u2019s name? Was it: Red Menace, Deep Blue or Silver Surfer? </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And I think it\u2019s Deep Blue.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Well, it sounds like you are more intelligent than a computer because you got the answer right. Yes, it was Deep Blue. The 1997 match was actually the second one between Kasparov and Deep Blue, a supercomputer designed by the company IBM and it was specialised in chess-playing. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, I think I might challenge Deep Blue to a game obviously. I\u2019m a bit of a genius myself.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Very good! Good to hear! Anyway, we\u2019ve just got time to remember some of the words and expressions that we\u2019ve used today, Neil.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>They were:</span></p>, <p><span>you\u2019ll need your wits about you </span></p>, <p><span>artificial</span></p>, <p><span>genius</span></p>, <p><span>synthetic</span></p>, <p><span>threat </span></p>, <p><span>to surpass</span></p>, <p><span>to pursue their goals</span></p>, <p><span>moral compass</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Thank you.

Welcome to 6 Minute English. With me in the studio today is Neil. Hello, Neil!</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Hello there, Rob!</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Now I bet you have an impressive CV, Neil. <strong>CV</strong> is short for curriculum vitae - that's a Latin expression we use for the document in which people list their work history, education, interests and abilities. In other parts of the English-speaking world it's called a resume. Now, Neil, I know you are a very good teacher and producer, but does your CV actually shine?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>Well, I hope it's good enough to impress hiring managers. But it's a challenge to prove on a piece of paper or online document that you're really better than the other people who are competing for the same position.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/> </strong>Today we're talking about CVs and you'll learn some words related to this topic, which will especially interest <strong>jobseekers </strong>- that's what we call people looking for work.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, and jobseekers have to worry about having an impressive CV so they get that call for a job interview.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/> </strong>Yes, the CV is just the beginning. And, as you mentioned job interviews, I'll ask you a question all about this. According to a recent survey, managers decide quite quickly if they're going to really consider giving a candidate a job or not. So, when you go for a job interview how long do you have, on average, to make a good enough impression for an employer to hire you? Do you have...</p>, <p>a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Less than 3 minutes</p>, <p>b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Less than 5 minutes\u00a0</p>, <p>c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Less than 10 minutes</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, I think it's probably quite short so I'm going to go for: (b) 5 minutes.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well, you'll have the correct answer - the result of this survey - at the end of the programme. But people have done all sorts of unusual things to reach the interview level. One of them is Briton Daniel Conway, who went from posing shirtless in the street with the phrase \"employ me\" written on his chest to uploading a video on social media asking to be hired.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Ah, this video went <strong>viral </strong>- it means became popular very quickly. In it his daughter appears next to the phrase \"give my dad a job\".</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes. Daniel Conway tells us about his experience looking for work. Which word does he use when he says he wanted to be noticed?</p>, <p><strong>Daniel Conway, former jobseeker<br/> </strong><em>I just thought as a young naive kid that I would kind of walk into a job, but the truth is, you know, there are a lot of good people out there who got just as great skills and I realised at that point that you've got <strong>to stand out</strong> and <strong>get your strengths across</strong>.</em></p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>He uses the phrasal verb to stand out - it means to be more visible than others in a group so that he can be noticed.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Dan Conway uses another phrasal verb: <strong>get your strengths across</strong> - to get something across means to make something clear. In this case he wants the employer to understand how good he is as a potential employee, his strengths and his good qualities.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And did he get a job?</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well, yes, he did. And I'm glad to say that after four years this 29-year-old man got a job marketing vitamins!</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, we can say that he was good at marketing himself.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/> </strong>Yes, we can. Well, he was bold and courageous in his attempts to catch potential employers' attention. He showed a quality described by career coach Corinne Mills. Listen to what she says and tell me: what is the quality jobseekers have to show for sure.\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Corinne Mills, MD - Personal Career Management<br/></strong><em>You've got to be <strong>confident</strong>! I mean, if you are not confident about your skills and abilities, then why should an employer have faith in you? So, don't be <strong>modest</strong>. This is your opportunity to really show your skills and experience and what a great performer you're gonna be in the job.</em></p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>The career coach says you've got to be confident! It means self-assured, believe in your capacity to do things. And sometimes we feel that it isn't nice to say \"I'm very good at this\" or \"I'm wonderful at that\" but she advises you not to be modest.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Exactly. Modest means humble, moderate when talking about your abilities.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>You know, Rob, I've got some top tips for people writing their CV.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>OK, well, let's have them.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>Yes. Here is the first one: you have to be <strong>concise </strong>- it means brief, give the information in a few words. Maybe you could write a brief profile at the top and keep the CV to just two pages.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Thank you. That's a good bit of advice. And I think you should give evidence of success in previous jobs. If a presentation you did helped you to get a client you should include it there. And be <strong>accurate</strong>, in other words, be precise and tell the truth. Don't invent things.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And you should also remember to check your spelling and grammar!</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes, that's very important! Well, we wish everybody success when writing and sending out their CV, and we hope they are called for a job interview, in which they have a very short period of time to leave a good impression...</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Indeed! So how long after all is this period of time, according to your survey? Did I get the answer to the question you asked at the beginning of the programme right?\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well, I asked you: how long do you have on average to make a good enough impression for an employer to hire you? Do you have less than 3 minutes, less than 5 minutes or less than 10 minutes?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I said less than 5 minutes.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And you're wrong. The correct answer is actually less than 10 minutes, so you'd have a little bit longer. Jobseekers have on average just six minutes and 25 seconds during the first meeting to impress potential employers. That's according to a new study from the website monster.co.uk. And we're almost out of time. So let's remember some of the words we said today, Neil.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>CV (curriculum vitae)\u00a0</p>, <p>viral\u00a0</p>, <p>to stand out\u00a0</p>, <p>get your strengths across\u00a0</p>, <p>confident\u00a0</p>, <p>modest\u00a0</p>, <p>concise\u00a0</p>, <p>accurate\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/> </strong>Thank you.

How are you?<strong>\u00a0</strong></p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>I'm very well, actually. The weather has been nice lately, hasn't it?<strong>\u00a0</strong></p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/> </strong>Yes, it has. The winter has been mild this year but... according to the forecast there might be some snow in parts of the country next week... And, you know, that's good because I love snow and we haven't seen much of it for quite a while. It's only rain, isn't it I...<strong>\u00a0</strong></p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>OK! OK! Enough! Enough now or they're going to think it's true that British people only talk about the weather!</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Right.\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>In this programme we're talking about conversation and how to start talking with people you don't know. In short: how to make <strong>small talk</strong>.<strong>\u00a0</strong></p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/> </strong>Right. Well, small talk is what we call a polite and informal conversation about things which aren't really important or meaningful when meeting people socially - like at a party, for example.\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And in this programme you'll learn some vocabulary about communication. But first, a question: Rob, when do babies usually start talking? Is it when they are...</p>, <p>a) 9 months</p>, <p>b) 16 months or</p>, <p>c) 18 months\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well, I know they start making noises at quite an early age. And I guess if that's talking, let me say (a) 9 months.\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>OK. Well, we'll have the answer to that question at the end of the programme. Small talk is a social skill. Some people feel <strong>awkward</strong> - it means they feel uncomfortable, embarrassed - when they go to a party and don't know many people there.\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/> </strong>Liz Brewer, the author of 'The Ultimate Guide to Party Planning and\u00a0<strong>Etiquette</strong>', knows a lot about what to do on these occasions. Etiquette is the set of rules which indicate what behaviour in a society is acceptable and what is not.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, the author knows a lot about etiquette. Let's listen to her advice. What expression does she use to describe the act of attempting to start a conversation with someone?<strong>\u00a0</strong></p>, <p><strong>Liz Brewer, author of 'The Ultimate Guide to Party Planning and Etiquette'<br/></strong><em>You walk into a room, there's a sea of faces, well... (the) first thing we do is... it's the weather. We do it because we are in fact <strong>breaking the ice</strong>. That is a code. That means 'I want to talk to you'. It's an easy subject, it's not too penetrating. We're very <strong>private </strong>people, we don't like to give too much information. So we are on safe ground. We start off with the weather. If that goes well, we then take it one step further.</em></p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/> </strong>Liz Brewer talks about breaking the ice. It means approaching someone you don't know and starting a friendly conversation with them.<strong><br/></strong></p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>And when you break the ice, talking about things which are not specific is the best way. You don't start a chat asking straight away where people live or what they do for a living.<strong>\u00a0</strong></p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/> </strong>And, as the author said, we are very private people. Private describes someone who doesn't like to give away their personal information, opinions or share their feelings. So we need more time to open up to people we've just met.<strong>\u00a0</strong></p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>Good. So now you know what to do at a party when you don't know the other guests.<strong>\u00a0</strong></p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/> </strong>But, Neil. There is one particular situation I'm not sure how to deal with. This is when I forget the name of the person I've been making small talk with.<strong>\u00a0</strong></p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>Yes, I know what that's like. You might not feel comfortable about allowing the person to realise you didn't really catch their name. It might sound <strong>rude</strong>.<strong>\u00a0</strong></p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/> </strong>Yes, that's right. I don't want to sound rude - which means ill-mannered or unpleasant. The person I've just managed to approach might think I don't care.\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Let's see what tip author on etiquette Liz Brewer has for us. Which words does she use instead of \"I have forgotten\"?\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Liz Brewer, author of \"The Ultimate Guide to Party Planning &amp; Etiquette\"<br/></strong><em>You can say \"Oh, just your name... it has just <strong>slipped my mind</strong> for the moment\". And they say \"Paul\", (you say) \"Oh no, no, no, I know you are Paul, it was the surname\". Or they give you the surname and then you add the other. As I say, small talk is a code towards getting information and going further. Once you feel comfortable, then you can have these wonderful in-depth conversations. Those are the kinds of things you want to probably do later.</em><strong>\u00a0</strong></p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/> </strong>Liz Brewer says \"your name has just slipped my mind\", it's a gentler way of saying that they've just forgotten the person's name. And pretending that you knew the person's name but you want the other name is a clever trick.\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, it might sound like you forgot the name, but not completely. And this author shows that you have to interact with people in a charming way.\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes... well, my co-presenter... your name has just slipped my mind for the moment...</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Come on, Rob. You know! You know it's Neil.\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes, it is Neil. I'm just practising my social skills there.\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, I'm afraid you have to practise some other time because... well, I don't want to sound rude but we are running out of time. Let me give you the correct answer to the quiz question now.\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes. You asked me \"When do babies usually start talking?\" and you gave me three options.\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, and the options were 9 months, 16 months or 18 months.\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And I went for the first one, 9 months. Was I right?\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>You were wrong. The correct answer was (c) 18 months. Now, according to the website webmd.com, there are some milestones in speech development. At 6 months, your baby begins babbling with different sounds. For example, your baby may say \"ba-ba\" or \"da-da\". And then, after that, at 9 months, babies can understand a few basic words. At the age of 18 months babies say up to 10 simple words.\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Ah, interesting stuff. And we are still learning words now, aren't we?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>We are. Well, enough of this small talk. Let's remember some of the words we used today, Rob.<strong>\u00a0</strong></p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>They were:</p>, <p>small talk</p>, <p>awkward</p>, <p>etiquette</p>, <p>breaking the ice</p>, <p>private</p>, <p>rude</p>, <p>slipped my mind\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>That's it for this programme.

Welcome to 6 Minute English. With me in the studio today is Neil. Hello, Neil.\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Hi. Hi Rob!</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Are you alright, Neil? Are you playing on your <strong>smartphone</strong> again, are you?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Err... what was that? Yeah, sorry, Rob... just doing something on my smartphone, you know, the kind of phone which allows you to go online.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Oh I can see that. But are you waiting for a call?<strong>\u00a0</strong></p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>No. No, I just carry it with me at all times. Where I go, the phone goes. No phone, no Neil!</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/> </strong>OK, but why do you need your phone so much?\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Why?! What if I need to need to go somewhere? How will I find my way? What about the weather? Will it rain today? I need to know these things.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Why don't you just look up in the sky and see if it is cloudy?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Look up to see if it is going to rain?! I have an <strong>app</strong> - which is short for an application, which is a computer programme for a specific purpose. My app tells me the weather... and this one does all the maths I need... and here's one for translations, and this one here... can tell me what I'm going to...</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>OK, OK, OK, I get the point. Today we're talking about computers - and we'll bring you some words <strong>connected</strong> with the digital age.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Connected - <strong>to connect</strong> - we use this verb a lot. It means 'to link, or join, one thing to another thing. In this case, connected means 'linked to the internet'.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>OK, I can see you are very excited about computers. So that's what my question is all about. The first commercially produced \"desktop computer\" was designed and produced by the Italian company Olivetti and presented at an event in New York. When did it happen? Was it in:</p>, <p>\u00a0</p>, <p>a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1955</p>, <p>\u00a0</p>, <p>b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1965 or</p>, <p>\u00a0</p>, <p>c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1975<strong>\u00a0</strong></p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, I think it's (a) 1955.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Very interesting. You'll get the right answer at the end of the programme. Now, let's talk about computers. You can't live without them but American technology writer Nicholas Carr, the author of a book called 'The Glass Cage - where automation is taking us', thinks they might cause problems.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Problems?! They cause us problems when they <strong>crash</strong> - that's what we say when our computer suddenly stops working.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well, not just that. Let's listen to Nicholas Carr. He says if we rely too much on computers we lose something. But what is it?</p>, <p><strong>American technology writer Nicholas Carr<br/></strong><em>The ability of computers to do things we used to do is growing astronomically and we're rushing to hand over to computers tasks, activities - both in our work lives and in our personal lives - and what you begin to see is what is often called a <strong>de-skilling</strong> effect. The person becoming reliant on computers; because they are not exercising their own <strong>talents</strong>, those talents begin to fade. And we begin to lose, as a result, the unique things that human beings can do that computers can't: feel <strong>empathy</strong>, take a broad perspective, interpret all the stuff that can't be turned into data.</em></p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>According to Nicholas Carr, using computers means that we are losing skills - he talks about 'de-skilling'. A skill is the ability to do something well because we've practised it.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/> </strong>And he also talks about the loss of talent - talent is a natural ability to do something - you didn't have to learn it, you're just naturally good at it. It's something we're all born with. Carr says that relying on computers means our talent is fading because we don't use it any more.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And he goes even further and says we're losing some of the things that make us human, like empathy, the ability to imagine and understand what other people might be feeling.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/> </strong>So, do you agree with this writer, Neil?\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>I think he's got a point actually.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/> </strong>It's like the friendships we make on social media. It is nice to get to know new people in different countries, but we have to remember that it's important to talk to people face-to-face too.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So... maybe we shouldn't use <strong>GPS</strong> to find our way around all the time. GPS, the global positioning system which gives us directions with the help of satellites orbiting the Earth... instead, have a conversation with someone - ask for directions.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes, and perhaps we can give the <strong>spellchecker</strong> a miss occasionally. A spellchecker is a very useful piece of software which helps us avoid making spelling mistakes when we're typing on a computer but... it is good to actually learn how to spell the words properly and not leave everything to the machine.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Good idea, Rob. I'll try not to rely so much on digital technology. Computers are here to stay and they'll become more and more sophisticated, but we have to remember they are just tools.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes, computers are here to stay. And by the way, when was the first commercially produced \"desktop computer\" launched? As I told you, it was designed and created by Olivetti and launched in New York. But when was it launched? Was it: 1955, 1965 or 1975?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I said 1955.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Perhaps you should ask your smartphone because the correct answer is actually (b) 1965.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I don't believe it!</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>The computer was called Programma 101 and it was presented at the New York World's Fair. They sold 44,000 units all over the world. The initial price in the US was US$ 3,200. Well, we are almost out of time so let's remind ourselves of some of the words we said today, Neil.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>smartphone</p>, <p>\u00a0</p>, <p>app (application)</p>, <p>\u00a0</p>, <p>to connect</p>, <p>\u00a0</p>, <p>crash</p>, <p>\u00a0</p>, <p>skill</p>, <p>\u00a0</p>, <p>talent</p>, <p>\u00a0</p>, <p>empathy</p>, <p>\u00a0</p>, <p>GPS (Global Positioning System)</p>, <p>\u00a0</p>, <p>spellchecker\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/> </strong>Thank you.

Welcome to 6 Minute English. With me in the studio today is Rob.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Hello, Neil.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Traditionally, January is the month in which people try to make their New Year's resolutions work. Some want to get fit, others swear they will drink less alcohol and there are those who want to stop smoking.</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Many people might wish to stop smoking here in England because, according to a plan, smoking in cars with children will be banned under new laws put forward by the government.</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And a similar move is being discussed in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Today we're talking about this new proposal restricting where people are allowed to smoke. And you'll learn some related vocabulary so you can have your own discussion on the subject.</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>We usually talk about smoking as a<strong> habit</strong> \u2013 that's what we do every day without even thinking and it's difficult to give up. Well, this ban is going to cause <strong>controversy</strong>, in other words, disagreement expressed in an angry, public way. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil</span></strong><span> <br/>Yes, smokers are trying hard to carry on enjoying their cigarettes. But there are a couple of places where they've already lost the battle, Rob.</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And where's that?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>I'm giving you a chance to tell me. Bans on smoking in cars where children are present already exist in some regions of particular countries. Is it:</span></p>, <p><span>a)</span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <span>in the French capital, Paris</span></p>, <p><span>b)</span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <span>in some US states</span></p>, <p><span>c)</span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <span>in Greece</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>I don't know but I'm gonna go for b) in some US states.</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>OK. Well, we'll have the answer to that question at the end of the programme. </span><span>Now let's hear the argument in favour of a ban. Here's Dr Hilary Wareing. She is the director of the Tobacco Control Collaborating Centre, which works with the World Health Organisation.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>The World Health Organisation is <strong>campaigning </strong>to discourage people from smoking. Campaigning means working in an organised and active way to achieve an objective.</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Listen out for what Dr Wareing calls the smoke from other people's cigarettes. \u00a0</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Dr Hilary Wareing, Tobacco Control Collaborating Centre in Britain<br/></span></strong><em><span>Those children who are exposed to <strong>second-hand smoke</strong> in cars are more likely to end up going to their doctors with respiratory infections, more likely to end up going to hospital with a respiratory infection and much more likely to get a wheeze or actually have <strong>asthma</strong> through their childhood. </span></em></p>, <p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>So Dr Wareing calls smoke from other people's cigarette <strong>second-hand smoke</strong>. Second-hand is something which has had a previous owner. \u00a0</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And she also mentions <strong>asthma</strong>. This is an illness you hear a lot about when people discuss the effects of tobacco smoke and pollution on people's lungs. People with asthma sometimes find it difficult to breathe. You faced this problem as a child, didn't you, Rob?</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Asthma? No, but when I was a kid my brother, who was much older than me, used to smoke in the car. Now, the smell was terrible, the smoke bothered me a lot and even if I don't have asthma now, I just don't like breathing in smoke. If people want to smoke, it's their personal choice, but not near me.</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>The proposal under discussion here in England includes a <strong>fine</strong> of up to \u00a350 \u2013 that's about $80 \u2013 imposed on the driver of the car if there's somebody smoking when there's a child passenger.</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>A fine is the money you pay as a punishment for having broken the law. And the driver is responsible, even if he is not the person smoking in the car. This will really cause some conflict.</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>It probably will. But it's difficult to find anyone who doesn't defend a child's right to be healthy. Children are <strong>vulnerable</strong> \u2013 vulnerable means they are exposed to harm and can't defend themselves. We have to protect them. But many smokers see this proposal with suspicion.</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes, in the last few years, smokers have seen restrictions in their ability to smoke. In many countries they aren't allowed to smoke in closed public places like bars anymore. And cigarette packages show disturbing pictures of diseased lungs.</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Smoking doesn't look so cool anymore. One of the smokers suspicious of the new ban is Hayley. This British driver said she doesn't smoke when her children are on board. But that's as far as she goes in agreeing with the ban.</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>What objection \u2013 I mean what reason for disagreeing \u2013 is she raising?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Listen out for the two words Hayley uses when talking about the physical area surrounding her which she feels is very personal.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Hayley, a smoker<br/></span></strong><em><span>If they are going to stop it with people in the cars with their children I completely agree with that. I completely understand where they are coming from, but to take it to the next level of stopping it even if you haven't got children in the car then I think that's a little bit beyond people's <strong>personal space</strong>, really.</span></em></p>, <p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Hayley talks about her personal space \u2013 it means the area around her body which she feels is hers and if invaded makes her feel uncomfortable. In this case, Hayley feels that her car is her personal space and she should be able to choose if she wants to smoke in it.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, it seems that enforcing this ban will be a bit of a challenge for the authorities. There's a ban on smoking inside buses but I tell you, sometimes I can smell smoke from somewhere.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>They breach the law at their own peril. But other places have managed to implement the ban on smoking in cars with child passengers. So what's the answer to the question you put earlier in the programme, Neil?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Where are people not allowed by law to smoke in private cars with children on board: is it Paris, some US states or Greece?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Well, I said some US states.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And you were correct!</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Oh good.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, the proposal here in England has yet to be voted for in Parliament and it might be implemented only by October. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>So plenty of time there for a good debate. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yes but two people who can't continue the discussion, at least for the moment, are both of us. That's because we've run out of time, Rob. Let's just remember some of the words used today.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>habit</span></p>, <p><span>controversy</span></p>, <p><span>campaigning</span></p>, <p><span>second-hand smoke</span></p>, <p><span>asthma</span></p>, <p><span>fine</span></p>, <p><span>vulnerable</span></p>, <p><span>personal space</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>That's it for today.

Hello, Neil!</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Hi there, Rob! </span></p>, <p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Today we are talking about a very serious topic: bullying. And you're going to learn some vocabulary related to this topic.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>It's a serious matter because it can leave people traumatised. </span></p>, <p><span><strong>Rob<br/>Traumatised</strong>, it means, they end up with emotional wounds which affect them psychologically. Bullies want to intimidate people.</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/>To intimidate</strong>, in other words, to make people fear them. Yes, it does make people feel they can't help themselves - they're powerless. They feel <strong>helpless</strong>.\u00a0 </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Unfortunately, bullying has been increasing in the workplace in spite of laws against it. Let's go for some figures. Are you ready for a question, Neil? </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, I am.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>The Workplace Bullying Institute based in the US conducted a survey last year. How much of the American workforce has experienced bullying at work? Was it: </span></p>, <p><span>a) 7%</span></p>, <p><span>b) 27%</span></p>, <p><span>c) 47%</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, I don't know but I\u2019m going to go for 27%.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>OK. I'll give you the answer by the end of the programme.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>I'm very keen to know, Rob. Intimidating people is a bad thing but some might say that, well, aggression is part of human nature.</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes, that's an interesting point, Neil. I can imagine big strong men imposing their will by force in the Stone Age, but behaving this way now probably isn't a good idea. The California-based anthropologist Christopher Boehm explains. Listen and then tell me: what made bullying go out of fashion?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Christopher Boehm, Anthropologist at the University of California, US<br/></span></strong><em><span>About a quarter of a million years ago, humans began to hunt zebras and antelope. And they had <strong>to cooperate</strong> to do so because their weapons were rather primitive and they did not want <strong>alpha males</strong> to be dominating the carcass after it was killed. So the thing that everyone else did was to start killing alpha males. Bullies simply were not tolerated.\u00a0\u00a0 </span></em></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Ah, people had <strong>to cooperate</strong> with each other - in other words, to work together for their mutual benefit. They were hunting animals for food.\u00a0 </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, and nobody wanted the <strong>alpha male</strong> - the strong man in the group who wanted to dominate everybody else - to take all the meat for himself.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>So about 250,000 years ago, when human society was evolving, people realised it wasn't good for the community to have a bully around. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>No. So if we make a big jump in history and back to the 21st\u00a0century, well, modern companies value cooperation. People's wellbeing matters too.</p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>That's right. Many countries have laws against bullying which is part of the companies' human resources policy. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span><strong>Human Resources</strong> - also known by the initials HR - is the department which hires new employees and stores information about their career at the company. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And what sort of behaviour is considered bullying in the civilised world?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>That's what Helene Guldberg is about to explain to us. She's a specialist in developmental psychology. What's the main thing that defines bullying?<br/><br/></span><strong><span>Helene Guldberg, developmental psychologist<br/></span></strong><em><span>Something that is <strong>intentional</strong> on the part of the perpetrator; it has to involve some kind of power imbalance, so it's not an argument between equals, and it's something that is repetitive. So it's not a one off rage by one person against another. The intent is to cause harm, which can be psychological or physical. </span></em></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>To be considered bullying, the behaviour has to be <strong>intentional</strong>, which means it has to be planned or deliberate. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And also has to happen many times and involve power. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, indeed. One person has to have more power than the other.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>You know, Rob, this idea of intention is very important, because some people are just more confident and demanding then others. They might say that they didn't mean to cause any harm. They don't mean to bully anyone.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Yes. But it can be interpreted differently. Darren Treadway, at the State University of New York, studied bullying in the workplace. He uses a word which means the way someone interprets something they see or hear. Which word is it?<br/><br/></span><strong><span>Darren Treadway, at the State University of New York, US<br/></span></strong><em><span>At the end of the day, if the target feels as if they're being bullied, the corporation needs to make sure they're addressing that feeling. If you're the supervisor who's... your subordinate says that they're being bullied by you or abused by you, while you may not feel you're doing that, it's your responsibility as a communicator to make sure that they are getting the accurate <strong>perception</strong> of your behaviour. Being known as a bully is a stigma that nobody in a corporation wants.</span></em></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>It's <strong>perception</strong>. According to Darren Treadway, bullying is a matter of perception - the way some action is interpreted by a person, in this case, a subordinate. </span></p>, <p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And supervisors have to be aware of how their subordinates see their behaviour. </span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>It's all a matter of communication. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, indeed. But we are running out of time, I'm afraid. Let's go back to the question I put to you earlier in the programme. It's about a survey by the Workplace Bullying Institute. I asked how much of the American workforce has experienced bullying in the workplace. The options were 7%, 27% and 47%.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And I guessed 27%.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>And you guessed very well. The answer is indeed 27%. What do you think about that?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, it's depressingly high, isn't it?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, it is. OK. Well, before we go, could you remind us of some of the words that we've heard today, Neil?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yes. We've heard: </span></p>, <p><span>traumatised</span></p>, <p><span>to intimidate</span></p>, <p><span>helpless</span></p>, <p><span>to cooperate</span></p>, <p><span>alpha male</span></p>, <p><span>human resources</span></p>, <p><span>intentional</span></p>, <p><span>perception</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Right.

Welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm joined today, at the start of a brand new year, by Neil.</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Hello, Rob! I'm really looking forward to 2015, but I have to say that last year was great. So great I'm thinking about creating my own time capsule.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Really? A <strong>time capsule</strong>? You mean a kind of box or container where you can store objects and information so that people in the future - yourself included - will know how we lived at this particular time?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>That's it! And I'm already collecting items. My old mobile phone which I don't use anymore. And a woolly jumper with a snowman on it my granny gave me that I never wear...</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>You never wear? </span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>It's a pretty silly jumper, Rob. She said it's to <strong>remind</strong> <strong>me</strong> of how much she loves me. Remind, which means, makes me remember - but all it makes me think of is that she still treats me like a child! I'll include the Christmas card which came with it! </span></p>, <p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well, you've got to choose the items you wish to keep as a memory of our time very carefully. It's a <strong>historical record</strong> - that usually means a piece of writing or a narrative of events at a particular time. Well, let's discuss time capsules and vocabulary related to memory. But first, a question to test your knowledge of time capsules. The International Time Capsule Society is based at Oglethorpe University in Atlanta, in the US, and it studies these artefacts. According to this organisation, how many time capsules are estimated to exist in the world today? Is it: </span></p>, <p><span>a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 up to 15,000</span></p>, <p><span>b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 up to 150,000 or</span></p>, <p><span>c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 up to 1,500,000</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I'm gonna go for (a) 15,000.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>OK, up to 15,000.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>That's the one.</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>OK. Well, as usual, you'll have the answer to that question at the end of the programme. Right, now, let's talk more about time capsules. One of them was in the news in the last couple of weeks. A capsule was found in a public building in Boston. </span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Ah, I've heard about this. Historians believe it was put there by Samuel Adams and Paul Revere, and other American revolutionaries in the 18th\u00a0century! </span></p>, <p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>OK. Let's listen to BBC reporter Rajini Vaidyanathan. Can you tell me exactly where this time capsule was hidden?</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rajini Vaidyanathan, BBC reporter in Washington<br/></span></strong><span><em>It was during repair work at the Massachusetts State House\u00a0in Boston that the time capsule was discovered hidden in the <strong>cornerstone</strong>. It\u2019s thought the time capsule was first placed there in the 1795, when the building was constructed. Officials believe it contains old coins and newspapers which could have <strong>deteriorated</strong> over time.</em> </span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Ah, the time capsule was hidden in the cornerstone, which is a stone representing the starting place in the construction of a monumental building. Usually it has the date carved on it.</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes the time capsule's items date from over 200 years ago, so the historians are concerned about opening it. The newspapers particularly might have <strong>deteriorated</strong>, decayed or decomposed over time.\u00a0 </span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Paper doesn't last long. But my old mobile phone - the one I'm going to put in my own time capsule - will be <strong>eternal</strong>, it means it will exist forever! And the historians of the future will be grateful! </span></p>, <p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well, if you want to make the historians happy, put things which are current in your life and things you actually use in your time capsule. There are famous capsules to be opened: the American company Westinghouse created two of them. One for the 1939 New York World's Fair and the other for the same event in 1964.</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And when are they going to open it? </span></p>, <p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>In the 25th\u00a0century! <strong>\u00a0</strong></span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Wow! Well, that's it, Rob. I'm going home and I'm going to start working on my own time capsule!</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Good. I'm glad to see you're so enthusiastic, Neil. But be careful not to make the mistake these guys in the Writtle Junior School here in England made. They put their items in a box 25 years ago and they buried the capsule in the garden.</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And what happened to it? It isn't centuries later but it must be interesting for these people who are now adults to see what's inside. </span></p>, <p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well, it would have been interesting. But it didn't happen. Listen to Headteacher Nick Taylor and tell me why they didn't open their time capsule.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Nick Taylor, Writtle School Headteacher<br/></span></strong><em>There were letters in it, coins, various things so we called in Writtle Heritage and they had a good explore around the garden with their <strong>metal detectors</strong>, and they couldn't find any evidence of it. I think we\u2019ve dug about three holes around\u00a0our school garden but we had to stop because we were slowly destroying it.</em></p>, <p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>They forgot where they buried it!</span></p>, <p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes. And they used <strong>metal detectors</strong> - electronic devices which can find metallic objects underground - and even so they couldn't find their time capsule! And before I forget, let's go back to the question I asked at the beginning of the programme.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>You asked how many time capsules are estimated to exist in the world today. </span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, and the options were up to 15,000, up to 150,000 or up to 1,500,000. And you said...</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, I said up to 15,000.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>And this is the right answer!</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Hurrah!</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Well done! Yes, the International Time Capsule Society has set up a registry of time capsules, and it estimates there are 10,000 to 15,000 time capsules worldwide. And the organisation believes that more than 80% of all time capsules are lost and will not be opened on their intended date.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, I will remember where I kept mine. That's for sure.</span></p>, <p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Good for you. Well, that's it from us for the moment. We've been talking about time and... we've run out of it. But let's just remember some of the words used today.

Welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm joined today by Finn.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Hi Rob! Merry Christmas everyone!</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes. Merry Christmas! Today we're talking about this celebration. It's a Christian festival but its message of peace among people is universal.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>It's a pity that today we are far from that - from a moment of absolute peace and <strong>goodwill</strong>. Now, goodwill means a cooperative attitude.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>But there was once a brief moment in history when the human spirit rose above wars.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Ah, you must be talking about the Christmas Truce which happened in World War One, in 1914!</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>It's the perfect occasion to talk about it, because this year marks the <strong>centenary</strong> - the 100 year anniversary - of the start of Britain's involvement in this European conflict. And we'll look at some related vocabulary during the programme. But, before we go into this extraordinary event, a question about the First World War, Finn.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>For me... well... I'm not an expert on the First World War so... we'll let's see how I do...</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>I'm sure you'll know the answer to this one. It's about letters. People didn't have email in the early 20th century so they wrote lots of letters. But do you know how many letters were delivered to the front - the place where the fighting happened - every week? Were there:</p>, <p>a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 one million</p>, <p>b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 five million or</p>, <p>c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 an incredible twelve million letters?</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Right. Well, I know there were a lot of people at the front but I'm going to say a) one million.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>OK. Well, as usual, you'll have the answer to that question at the end of the programme. Right, now, let's talk about this <strong>unofficial truce</strong> which happened 100 years ago in the Western Front of the First World War.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Yes, so a truce is an agreement between people to stop fighting, with no winner or loser. Now, it's <strong>unofficial</strong> - which means it's not authorised by people in a position of authority, in this case, the governments involved in the war. So the soldiers just decided to simply stop fighting. How was this possible, Rob? How did this happen?</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well, soldiers from both <strong>trenches</strong>, all of a sudden, started to <strong>fraternise</strong> - which means they began to meet each other socially.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And the trenches were big holes dug by soldiers from which they attacked the enemy. Living conditions were terrible in these holes.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>This truce might have had something to do with the bad conditions in these trenches. Let's hear what German historian Michael Jurgs has to say about the event. Which expression does he use to describe how the soldiers felt about the war?</p>, <p><strong>INSERT</strong></p>, <p><strong>Michael Jurgs, author of The Small Peace in the Great War<br/></strong>I think it happened because they were all <strong>fed up with</strong> the war. They were promised they would be at home again, Christmas 1914 and after five months of the World War One, there were already a million dead young people, eighteen, nineteen, twenty years old. And at Christmas night the muddy weather became frosty and cold and then from the German trenches, from the German trenches - that sounds unbelievable because always Germans started wars, or joined wars - began the song, 'Silent Night, Holy Night'. That was the beginning.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>The German historian said the soldiers were fed up with the war - which is an informal way of saying they were bored, or annoyed with it.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>The war was continuing and they wished they were home with their families. One night, it was cold and the German soldiers started to sing a song... a carol...</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Yes. A carol is a happy song with a religious element - usually a Christmas song. And the carol they sang was (sings a bit of Silent Night).</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>(Joins in the singing) Yes. That's the carol 'Silent Night, Holy Night' and it <strong>broke the ice</strong> between the soldiers. That means it made these men, who didn't know each other personally, more relaxed.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And you know Rob? I really find it fascinating how spontaneous all of this was!</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>It was indeed.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>So how did the authorities respond to this?</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>They didn't like it at all. They banned this sort of fraternising and it didn't happen again. But not before the soldiers from opposing armies played some football together.<strong>\u00a0</strong></p>, <p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Football?!</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes. They played a match in <strong>no-man's-land</strong>! That's a strip of land between enemy sides over which nobody has control. It was the area between the English trench and the German trench.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>You know, it's a really nice story, isn't it? It's quite a touching story, Rob.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes, and very inspiring. Well, our time is almost up so let's get the right answer to the quiz question. I asked you how many letters were delivered to the front every week. The options were: one million, five million or twelve million.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And I said one million, Rob.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And you were a long way off.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Oh, really?</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes. The correct answer is (c) twelve million letters.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Twelve million a week?!</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes, a week. By the end of the war, two billion letters and 114 million parcels had been delivered to the front.\u00a0 According to statistics, 65 million people around the world fought in this war, which ended in 1918.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>That's really quite incredible Rob!</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Some incredible figures there. OK. Let's remember some of the words we explained today.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>They were:</p>, <p>goodwill</p>, <p>centenary</p>, <p>truce</p>, <p>unofficial</p>, <p>trenches</p>, <p>fraternise</p>, <p>fed up with</p>, <p>carol</p>, <p>broke the ice</p>, <p>no-man's-land</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Thank you, Finn.

You look OK, but what you really mean is you're not as fluent as you were before!</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>That's right.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Learning, and practising, a language requires effort.

In the playground \u2013 that's the area in the schoolyard where children play during their break between lessons \u2013 they speak 42 languages?! Wow.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes. Of course they all have to learn English because they live here. But more on that in a moment. First, as the tradition goes, I'm going to challenge you with a question, Finn.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>OK. I'm ready or... \u6211\u51c6\u5907\u597d\u4e86!</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Huh?</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>I'm ready!</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>OK. Which country has the most official languages? Is it:</p>, <p>a) India</p>, <p>b) Nigeria</p>, <p>c) South Africa</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Good question. I would say India or Nigeria... Let's say Nigeria.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>OK. I will reveal the answer at the end of the programme! So let's talk about Byron Court, a school with 600 pupils in north-west London.\u00a0The school gets high <strong>marks</strong> for <strong>integration</strong>.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Marks - so here you mean scores in tests or exams. They get high marks for integration - integration means bringing people together - as they have pupils from all over the world.\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes, they come from places as far apart as Iraq, Somalia, India, Romania and Slovakia. Many are children of immigrants and refugees.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>So how difficult is it for these children to learn English?</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well, let's listen to this pupil from Byron Court. Where did she learn her first words in English?</p>, <p><strong><strong>Pupil, Byron Court school, London<br/></strong></strong><em>When I was two years old I went to nursery and then I learnt a bit of English there. And when I came here I got to learn all my English.</em></p>, <p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>She says she began to learn English at nursery - that's a place where very young children are looked after while their parents are at work.<strong style=\"font-size: 12px;\">\u00a0</strong></p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Byron Court's <strong>head teacher</strong>\u00a0- the person in charge of a school - believes children feel integrated because she tries to celebrate all the different cultures and avoids suggesting one culture is better than the other.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>It all sounds very nice, Rob, but I wonder what happens in the classroom. I mean, many pupils are learning basic words in English while, at the same time, studying things like science and maths also in English. So, quite a challenge?</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>It is indeed a big problem.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>So does this lower <strong>educational standards</strong>?\u00a0Those are the knowledge and skills students should have at a particular level.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes it does, but not for long, says Martyn Pendergast, educational officer at Brent Council, that's the area where the school is located. Listen out for the verb he uses which means testing children's performance.</p>, <p><strong>Martin Pendergast, educational officer at Brent Council<br/></strong><em>In Brent our children perform just below national averages when they are assessed at seven years old. But by the time they're 11 they've caught up with national standards, and at 16 they're flying.</em></p>, <p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>He says they are assessed - which means tested and given scores - when they are seven years old. At that time they have worse results than children in other British schools.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>But by the time they celebrate their 11th birthday, they've caught up - they've become equal with pupils of their age elsewhere in the country.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And by 16, he says, \"they are flying\", which is a nice way to describe these children's progress.\u00a0It's good for them because they end up as <strong>bilingual</strong> adults - speaking two languages fluently.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>So their effort pays off. At Byron Court the concern is more about pupils who are native speakers of English.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Parents worry about their children not learning much.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Maybe the best thing is for everybody to try to learn a second language. Not a bad thing in today's small world.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Talking about learning languages, I want to know if I got the answer to your question right. The question was about the country with the most official languages.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And the options I put to you were India, Nigeria or South Africa. \u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And I said Nigeria. But... maybe I think India now. Can I change my mind?</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>You can if you want because you'd still be wrong.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Oh, no, really?</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>The country with most official languages is the Republic of South Africa with 11 languages.\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Eleven!</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Interestingly India has 18 languages that are recognised by its constitution and can be considered as official, however, the difference is that each language is recognised as the official language of a certain area such as Kashmir, for example.\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>OK. Right. So I was kind of right in a different way.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>The overall official language is Hindi.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Fascinating! Well, lots of languages to learn, in any case.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>I'll stick with English for now.

But you might not thank me for it after the programme.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Why's that?</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Because a paper published by the British Medical Journal says that laughter is not always the best medicine, and sometimes, it can actually be harmful.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, in that case I definitely won't be laughing at your jokes any more! And, to be honest, it wasn't funny anyway.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Anyway, today we'll be exploring the connection between laughter and health, and looking at some health-related vocabulary. But before we get into the story, Neil: a question. You're a parent. At what age do babies begin to laugh? Is it:</p>, <p>a) 0-3 months</p>, <p>b) 3-6 months</p>, <p>c) 6-8 months</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Right I'm pretty sure, unless my memory is very bad, that it's a) 0-3 months.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>OK, well, we will find out if you're right at the end of the programme. OK, so laughter, as I said, is generally thought of as a good thing. There's a phrase I said earlier which is: <strong style=\"font-size: 12px;\">laughter is the best medicine</strong>.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, and talking of medicine, there are many medical studies which examine the benefits of laughter - it reduces stress, it's good for your heart, things like that. But now you're telling me it can have some negative effects?</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Well, why don't we listen to Professor Robin Ferner, who is one of the authors of the research paper. How many negative effects of laughter does he mention?</p>, <p><strong>INSERT<br clear=\"none\"/></strong><strong>Robin Ferner, University of Birmingham<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>We found people with heart rhythm disturbance which had stopped their heart, we found people who had fainted, we found people whose gullets had burst, we found people who'd dislocated their jaws or burst their lungs.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Quite a few! It seems laughing can be<strong style=\"font-size: 12px;\"> no laughing matter!</strong><strong style=\"font-size: 12px;\">\u00a0</strong></p>, <p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Indeed - he mentions five problems caused by laughter, including heart rhythm disturbance, fainting, burst gullets, dislocated jaws and even burst lungs.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Some of those sound quite nasty.<strong style=\"font-size: 12px;\"> Fainting</strong> is when you lose consciousness and pass out; and your<strong style=\"font-size: 12px;\"> gullet</strong> is the tube through which food passes from the mouth to the stomach, so a burst gullet would be horrible.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>I think it would be very bad! We also heard about burst <strong style=\"font-size: 12px;\">lungs</strong> - lungs are the organs in your chest that you use to breathe. And - I think you'd have to be laughing really hard to do this - to get a <strong style=\"font-size: 12px;\">dislocated jaw</strong>. To dislocate something is to move it out of its normal place or position, so you dis-locate it. A dislocated jaw - ouch.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, thankfully there is no danger of dislocated jaws with your jokes Finn!</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>OK! Well, in fact, these five dangers are only some that were mentioned in the study.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>But surely, there must have been some positive findings?</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Yes, let's listen to Professor Robin Ferner again - which health benefit does he mention?</p>, <p><strong>INSERT<br clear=\"none\"/></strong><strong>Robin Ferner, University of Birmingham<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>You actually use energy when you laugh, you move your diaphragm, you expand your lungs, and both those things can be helpful. For example, it's said that laughing for quarter of an hour will burn up 40 kcal, and if you laughed all day you'd use up about 2,000 calories.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>That's more like it! Laughing can help you lose weight, because you use energy when you laugh.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>In fact, quite a lot of energy: if you laughed all day you'd use 2,000 calories, which is what most people consume in a day.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>He also thinks laughing makes people feel better, and it can reduce the chance of having a <strong style=\"font-size: 12px;\">heart attack</strong>.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So overall - what's the story - laughing: good or bad?</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Well, he says for most people, most of the time, laughing is a great thing. And well, that's good, because I like to laugh, don't you Neil?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Oh yes I do.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Earlier I asked you Neil, at what age do babies begin to laugh? Was it 0-3 months, 3-6 months or 6-8 months?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I said 0-3 months.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Well, Neil, the answer was in fact b) 3-6 months. A little bit later! And 0-3 months, which was your answer, Neil, is when babies smile for the first time.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, you <strong style=\"font-size: 12px;\">had the last laugh</strong> there Finn.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Very good - and if you have the last laugh it means you're successful in the end.

You don't mean the one in the sky, of course.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>No.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>You mean the huge computers where companies like Apple, Facebook and Google store their users' pictures, videos and documents.

They were leaked to the public. Actress Jennifer Lawrence, who starred in the <em style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Hunger Games </em>movies, was one as was the singer Rhianna.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>This incident has made people discuss the issue of <strong style=\"font-size: 12px;\">privacy</strong> on the internet. Privacy means being free from public attention. And in this programme you'll hear useful words for giving your opinion on this subject.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Yes. The celebrities were very angry.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>They thought they could keep their pictures private because they were in the cloud protected by a <strong style=\"font-size: 12px;\">password </strong>- a word or sequence of numbers that only they knew and which is required for them to gain access to what is stored in their name.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>The US federal police - that's the FBI - have been investigating this to find the <strong style=\"font-size: 12px;\">hackers</strong> involved. Hackers are people who understand a lot about computers and use flaws - or little problems - in the software to gain access to a computer file, or network, illegally.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Today we have passwords for everything. And we have so many devices - like smartphones and laptops and computers - so I'm going to ask you a question about smartphones.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>OK. Very good.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>According to research, how many people had mobile phones in 2013? Was it:</p>, <p>a) 1.4 million people</p>, <p>b) 14 million people</p>, <p>c) 1.4 billion people</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Across the whole world?</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yup.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>I think this is got to be: c) 1.4 billion people.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well, you'll get the correct answer at the end of the programme. Right. Let's talk more about privacy online. People are more and more concerned about it. Listen to the advice internet expert Oliver Crofton gives us. Which word does he use to describe how you have to be when putting things into the cloud?<strong style=\"font-size: 12px;\">\u00a0</strong></p>, <p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Oliver Crofton, expert on the internet<br/></strong>I think ultimately it's about being slightly <strong style=\"font-size: 12px;\">savvy</strong> on what you put into the cloud. If you have a private or sensitive photograph, or a contract or some sort of document that has public interest and that people will want to try and get, just think twice about putting it into an environment such as a Cloud, of which you don't really have any control over.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>He says people have to be 'savvy' - now, that means well-informed and quite shrewd, you know, thinking carefully about things. He advises us to be very careful before putting documents and pictures onto these websites owned by big corporations.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes, because he says we don't have any control over their computers - you don't know how secure your documents are.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Yeah, you know Rob, I can see why people are suspicious of these things.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well, let's see what the BBC technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones has to say. Rory explains howsome cloud companies are offering to make the cloud more secure. Which word does he use to describe this kind of security process and it also means 'identification of the user'?</p>, <p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Rory Cellan-Jones, BBC technology correspondent<br/></strong>Many cloud companies now offer an added layer of security called 'two-factor <strong style=\"font-size: 12px;\">authentication</strong>', where users have to enter a code sent to their mobile phone as well as a password to get into their accounts.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>OK, the word was 'authentication' - now, that's confirmation that someone is who they say they are. And the company actually uses two steps to do this.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes. After you try to access your account, they send a code - probably a series of numbers - to your mobile phone, so it's an extra bit of information that only you know.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>We really all should be very careful about how we protect our computers, and our tablets and our smartphones, things like that.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Talking about smartphones, let's go back to my question.\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>OK.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>I asked you how many people had mobile phones in 2013. Was it: 1.4 million people, 14 million people, or 1.4 billion people?</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And I said 1.4 billion - the big one.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And you are correct!\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>OK!</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes, by the end of 2013, about 1.4 billion people owned and used smartphones and by the end of 2014 this number will increase by 25% - this is according to the research company eMarketer.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Wow! What a lot of phones, Rob!</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Indeed. Well, our time is up so let's remember some of the words we've explained today.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>They were:</p>, <p><strong>cloud</strong></p>, <p><strong>leak</strong></p>, <p><strong>privacy</strong></p>, <p><strong>password</strong></p>, <p><strong>hackers</strong></p>, <p><strong>savvy</strong></p>, <p><strong>authentication</strong></p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>That's it for today.

I'm Finn, and Rob's here too.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Yes, hello.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Hi. Rob - tell me - do you have a spare room in your house?</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Absolutely not. We're full to capacity in our house.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>And what about a <strong>driveway</strong> for your car?</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>A driveway - so you mean a parking space off the road at my house? Not exactly a driveway, but yes I do have a parking space, yes.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Well - both of these are ways of making money in the 'sharing economy'. Interested? Well, we'll be talking about this new economy in the programme, and learning some language related to making money. But first - a question.<strong>\u00a0</strong></p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Great. I don't have to pay for it do I?</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>It's a free question. But no prize either.\u00a0In February 2014, Britain's most expensive parking space went on sale, but for how much? Was it:</p>, <p>a) \u00a380,000</p>, <p>b) \u00a3100,000\u00a0</p>, <p>c) \u00a3400,000</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Well, it's just a parking space isn't it? So I'm going to go for the lowest value: \u00a380,000.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\u00a380,000 - still a lot of money. We'll find out if that's the right answer at the end of the programme. But first, let's find out a bit more about this sharing economy. Rob, are you <strong>feeling the pinch</strong>?\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Feeling the pinch - you mean feeling poor. Yes, I'm always feeling the pinch. So come on Finn, tell us how we can make some money.\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Well, perhaps the best-known example of a company in the sharing economy is Airbnb - it's an American web business which allows you to rent out your spare room to <strong>holidaymakers</strong>.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>OK. Holidaymakers - so these are people on holiday. Using your spare room as a B and B - that's a bed and breakfast?</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Yes - you can provide breakfast for your guests too...\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>That sounds like a clever way to <strong>make a few pennies</strong>.\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Yes, to make a few pennies - to make a bit of extra money.\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>OK well, Airbnb say they operate in 34,000 cities and have 800,000 listings of rooms and apartments. In fact, we could say they're the <strong>market-leader </strong>in this industry - the main, most successful company.\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>There are many companies doing very similar things. And one doing something with parking spaces is JustPark. It's a British business that lets you rent out your driveway or parking space.\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Another way to make money <strong>on the side</strong> - which means to make some extra money in addition to your normal job. We're going to hear from the founder of JustPark now, Anthony Eskinazi. Where did the idea for the business come from?</p>, <p><strong>Anthony Eskinazi, founder of JustPark<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>When I had the original idea, I spotted a driveway close to a sports stadium. It would have been so convenient if I could have just parked in that driveway rather than in a <strong>commercial </strong>car park.<em>\u00a0</em></p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>So, Anthony said that he got the idea when trying to park near a stadium. He said he saw a driveway. He thought it would be more convenient to just park there than in a commercial car park - a normal one which makes money.\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>So he set up this site. And around 20,000 people have put their spaces on the site, and he says around half a million drivers use it.\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Interestingly, a church near Kings Cross in central London has apparently made over \u00a3200,000 by renting out space in its yard to travellers!<strong>\u00a0</strong></p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>And of course there are other sites doing very similar things, like Uber and Lyft - these let drivers share their cars with other passengers.\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>And there's even a company in Hong Kong which lets you share space under your umbrella when it rains!\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>That sounds like <strong>one for a rainy day</strong>.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Haha - an idea to store away until you need it. But I do have a question. What about the people who run things like traditional B and Bs, or commercial car parks - or taxi services - things like that? Won't they be <strong>out of pocket</strong>?</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Out of pocket, yes - lose money. Many of them are out of pocket and are not happy about this. And there is another issue: <strong>regulations</strong> - or laws. Listen to the editor of <em>Tech City News</em>, Alex Wood. Why are regulations for these new businesses unclear?</p>, <p><strong>Alex Wood, editor of Tech City News<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Take the example of someone who has a driveway in their house. They've got some spare capacity there - they're looking to make some more money. But how does that affect their neighbours? How does that affect the Council and the regulation and the rules around them? Because this is a new business world, those rules aren't there yet.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Well, he says they're unclear - because the rules aren't there yet. Because it's a whole new business world.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>In fact, Airbnb has had problems with the law. But, in a time when the economy is doing badly, these businesses seem to be <strong>thriving</strong> - doing really well - and provide an extra <strong>source of income</strong> for many people.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>That's right. Many are benefitting from this new economy. But others are out of pocket. That's business. Rob, what about us? Could you make some money from this sharing economy? You could rent out your bike - your lovely folding bike - while you're at work?</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>That's a really good idea - it's kind of a downtime, the bike's not being used, so why not! Anyway - how about the answer to today's question?<strong>\u00a0</strong></p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Yes, earlier I asked you about the most expensive parking space ever to go on sale in London. How much was it on sale for?</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Well, I had a guess and I said \u00a380,000.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Well, you were completely wrong.

Rob's here today. Hi Rob.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Hello Finn \u2013 are you well?</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Very well, thanks. Rob, tell me \u2013 do you have a favourite <strong>science-fiction</strong> movie?</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Ahh, science fiction \u2013 stories about an imagined future \u2026 well my favourite was and always will be <em>ET: Extra Terrestrial</em>, and you Finn?</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Mine would probably be <em>Blade Runner</em> \u2013 the movie with Harrison Ford set in a dark, scary Los Angeles where he hunts robots called replicants. You know the one?</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>I do \u2013 and come to think of it, lots of movies and stories about the future are quite dark and negative \u2026</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>But perhaps this might change. A new project wants to use the power of science fiction to do something very different: to inspire people to create a better future. It sounds very grand. We'll be discussing the project and learning some language to talk about the future in this programme.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>But before we get <em>too</em> far into the future, I'm sure you have a question for me, Finn?</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Yes indeed. It's about the film <em>Blade Runner</em>. It's set in the future \u2013 but in which year?</p>, <p>a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2000</p>, <p>b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2019</p>, <p>c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2056</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>I think I'm gonna go for the far future, c) 2056.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Well I'll tell you if you're right or wrong later\u00a0<strong>in the not-too-distant future</strong>.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Very good. So, as we were saying: lots of science fiction is negative.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Yes, there's a word to describe the kind of future world which often appears in science fiction: <strong>dystopian</strong>. The noun 'dystopia' means an imagined place where things are unpleasant or bad. The opposite is <strong>utopia</strong> and\u00a0<strong>utopian</strong>.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>But why is so much science fiction dystopian? Dr Braden Allenby from Arizona State University.</p>, <p><strong>Braden Allenby, Professor of Engineering and Ethics, Arizona State University</strong></p>, <p>The <strong>downside</strong> of both of science fiction and movies is that they tend to be dystopian, they tend to be very negative, they tend to be very noir. Dystopian is easier to do. It's easier to write a dystopian story than it is to write an optimistic story.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>He says dystopian stories are easier to write. I can see that \u2013 there's more conflict in a world which has problems \u2013 and good stories often have a lot of conflict and problems to resolve.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Yes, but Braden thinks being negative is the downside of science fiction. A downside is a disadvantage, a bad point. He would prefer to see more <strong>optimistic</strong> science fiction.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Optimistic, more positive about the future, which is why Braden is taking part in something called Project Hieroglyph. It brings together writers, scientists, engineers and artists to create optimistic stories about things which really could happen in the next 50 years.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>So let's talk about the kinds of things are happening in these stories?</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Well, there's one about a huge tower 20 km tall \u2013 going all the way into space. Apparently, building the tower is good for the US steel industry \u2026 and they invent a new kind of energy in the story too.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Sounds very interesting \u2013 but is it <strong>plausible</strong> \u2013 could it really happen? Could they really build a tower that big?</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Well, there's another about <strong>environmentalists</strong> who fight to stop people building the first hotel in Antarctica.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Environmentalists \u2013 people who care about the environment. Well there's conflict there \u2026 and it's plausible, so it could be a good story. But I can't help thinking \u2013 will these stories actually change anything?</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Ed Finn, who edited a book of these stories, thinks so. He says: \"A good science-fiction story can be very powerful\". \"It can inspire hundreds, thousands, millions of people to <strong>rally around</strong> something that they want to do.\"</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>To rally around something means to come together in support of a cause.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>And Braden Allenby says you can already see the influence of science fiction in modern research. Which item is being worked on right now?</p>, <p><strong>Braden Allenby, Professor of Engineering and Ethics, Arizona State University</strong></p>, <p>\"Why are people working on, for example, invisibility cloaks? Well, it's Harry Potter, right? That's where they saw it.\"</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>An invisibility cloak \u2013 a long coat which makes you <strong>invisible,</strong> in other words unable to be seen \u2013 which people first saw in one of the\u00a0<em>Harry Potter</em> movies.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Interesting \u2026 so will the stories from Project Hieroglyph inspire people to do and invent new things that can help others? Can they help create <strong>a</strong> <strong>bright future</strong> \u2013 that's a good, positive future? Or will they just be good stories?</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong><strong>Time will tell</strong> \u2013 that means we'll find out as time goes by. One thing that we're going to find out right now is the answer to when the movie <em>Blade Runner</em> was set?</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>I said the answer was c) 2056.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>And the answer was in fact b) 2019. A little bit earlier, Rob.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Quite soon, then?</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Yes, it's in a couple of years. So, watch out LA. But,\u00a0Rob, can you remind us of some of the words we learned today?</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>We had \u2026</p>, <p>science fiction</p>, <p>dystopian</p>, <p>downside</p>, <p>optimistic</p>, <p>plausible</p>, <p>a bright future</p>, <p>time will tell</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>And that's it for today's programme.

I'm Rob \u2026</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\u2026 and hello, I'm Finn.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Now Finn, there is nothing I like more than <strong>tucking into</strong> a juicy steak, munching on a hamburger or chewing on a nice piece of roast beef.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>It does sound good, doesn't it? But meat eaters, like us, might need to think again about the amount we eat.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>That's right because in the programme today we're discussing how eating meat can add to the problem of <strong>greenhouse gas</strong>.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Greenhouse gas is a type of gas that stops heat escaping from the atmosphere and causes a greenhouse effect \u2013 it warms up our planet \u2013 and that leads to climate change.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Yes, that's it's not a good thing. We have heard in the past about greenhouse gas being caused by pollution from factories\u2026</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>\u2026 and from using containers of things like paint or perfume, which is kept under high pressure so that it can be sprayed \u2013 we call these aerosols.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>But according to a recent report, the production of meat is also adding to the problem. We'll talk more about this soon and looking at some related vocabulary, but not before we've set today's question. Are you ready, Finn?</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Ready and waiting, Rob.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>According to a study in America, how many tonnes of beef is produced globally every year?</p>, <p>a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 59 million tonnes</p>, <p>b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 69 million tonnes</p>, <p>c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 79 million tonnes</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Let's go supersize and say 79 million tonnes.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>I'll let you know the answer at the end of the programme. Let's continue our discussion about the link between meat and greenhouse gases.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Research from Cambridge and Aberdeen universities estimates greenhouse gases from food production will go up 80% if meat and dairy <strong>consumption</strong> continues to rise at its current rate. 'Consumption' here means the process of eating food.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>So more and more of us are eating meat \u2013 there is a surge. Let's find out exactly why from BBC Environment Analyst, Roger Harrabin. See if you can hear why meat production is causing the problem \u2026</p>, <p><strong>INSERT<br/>BBC Environment Analyst, Roger Harrabin<br/></strong>The surge in meat eating will drive more deforestation as farmers seek increasing amounts of land, the study says. Cutting forests releases greenhouse gases from the wood and the soil, and fertilisers create greenhouse gases too. The report says under current trends, agriculture alone will cause the world to bust its targets for reducing the risk of dangerous climate change.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>So eating more meat means farmers need more land to keep their animals on. And to get more land, they need to cut down trees \u2013 which is called <strong>deforestation</strong>.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>It's deforestation \u2013 cutting down forests \u2013 that causes greenhouse gases from wood and soil to be released. And there's another reason too \u2013 the use of <strong>fertilisers</strong>.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>These are natural or chemical substances added to the soil to help plants grow. Like these plants, used to feed the animals.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>And another problem is that more of the fields used for growing crops that we eat, like wheat, are being used to grow food to feed the animals that we later eat!</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Research has also found beef cattle need 28 times more land than pork, poultry or dairy farming.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>So it's a big problem, but many of us have an <strong>appetite</strong> \u2013 a need or interest \u2013 for meat. Especially for <strong>carnivores. </strong>Carnivores are really animals that just eat meat but we refer to humans as carnivores too sometimes because they just love meat.\u00a0Something else is tempting us too.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Yes, something is encouraging us to eat more. See if you can hear what it is in the next part of Roger Harribin's report\u2026</p>, <p><strong>INSERT<br/>BBC Environment Analyst, Roger Harrabin<br/></strong>The real challenge is the public's appetite. There's a burger restaurant boom in major cities. People are voting with their bellies and it's not normally mushroom burgers they're after!</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Some interesting language there. He described the increase in burger restaurants as a<strong> 'boom'</strong> \u2013 so a major increase. And he said people are voting with their bellies \u2026</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>A nice phrase \u2013 he means, people are showing they like burger restaurants by going to them and eating more.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>And they're not buying burgers made of vegetables or things like mushroom burgers \u2013 they're buying and eating meat, like beef burgers.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Well, with meat consumption predicted to double in the next 40 years as people globally get wealthier, it's a problem that's not going to go away.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>A bit like today's question \u2013 today's question was, according to a scientific study in America, how many tonnes of beef is produced globally every year?</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>I said c) 79 million tonnes.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>That's a lot to eat but you are wrong. The answer is 59 million tonnes. This is according to the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. It also found cattle are the biggest source of greenhouse gases, accounting for more than three-quarters of all gases made by farming livestock around the world. Well before we chew over that fact, Finn could you please remind us of some of the words we have heard today?</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Ok:</p>, <p>tucking into</p>, <p>greenhouse gas</p>, <p>consumption</p>, <p>deforestation</p>, <p>fertiliser</p>, <p>appetite</p>, <p>carnivore</p>, <p>boom</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Well, that brings us to the end of today's 6 Minute English.

So you don't have any special <strong>superpowers </strong>- amazing skills and abilities that can be used for saving people and fighting against evil?</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Well, lots of powers, but no superpowers. I'm afraid not. Superheroes, of course, tend to be <strong>fictional</strong> characters \u2013 they're made-up characters, who appear in comics and books and movies.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>You mean characters like Batman, Spiderman and Wonder Woman. Do you have a favourite?</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>I do actually. Spiderman was my favourite when I was growing up. And he can climb up walls and I really wanted to do the same - I tried to climb up the walls in my house and sadly I failed because superheroes are fictional - they aren't real!</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Well some real-life superheroes do exist and that's what we'll be talking about today and we'll be explaining some words related to superheroes. But first a question...</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Can I use my superpowers to answer this one?</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>You can try. What year did Superman first appear published in a comic book?</p>, <p>a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1930</p>, <p>b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1934</p>, <p>c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1938</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>My <em>spidey</em> sense tells me it's 1934.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>I'll tell you if you're right or wrong at the end of the programme. Now let's find out more about some real-life superheroes. These are people who don't really have superpowers but they are doing something <strong>extraordinary</strong>.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>So they are doing something special - but most importantly, they are doing something good.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>People often describe someone who has done something brave, such as saving someone's life, as a hero. Firefighters are sometimes described as heroes because they often risk their lives to save others.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>But heroes don't have to be <strong>life-savers</strong>. We sometimes describe a person with great intelligence or amazing abilities as 'our hero' - a musician maybe or an athlete. It's someone we <strong>admire</strong> and look up to.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Well there's a man in Japan who's recently been described as a 'superhero'. To be honest, I don't think his powers are superhuman - that means a power that ordinary humans don't have - but what he does is rather unusual and he gives up his free time doing it.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Tell me more Rob.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>This is Chibatman - named after the city of Chiba where he comes from. His <strong>mission</strong> - his purpose - is to make the people of the city happy.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>That's a worthwhile mission.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>It is. Chibatman has been spotted 'flying' through the streets of Chiba dressed a bit like Batman and riding his custom-built three-wheeled Chibatpod. But why? Is he just a bit crazy or does he have <strong>honourable</strong> intentions?</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>You mean does he genuinely want to do good things and make things better?</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Well, listen to what he says, speaking through a translator, and see if you can hear what his reasons are \u2026 \u00a0</p>, <p><strong>INSERT<br clear=\"none\"/>'Chibatman' - Chiba superhero<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>I started doing this around three years ago. As for my reasons: during the great earthquake people forgot how to smile. I wanted to help bring the smile back and that's why I started.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>OK, so because of the devastation caused by the earthquake and tsunami in 2011, he felt people had forgotten how to smile. So his mission was to get people smiling again. That's something we could describe as being 'honourable'.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>What is interesting about him and other superheroes is they keep their identity <strong>closely-guarded</strong> - nobody knows who the real man in the costume is.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>That's also true for another Japanese man who's been called a superhero. Mr Full Moon wears a costume to hide his identity when he goes around cleaning the streets of Tokyo.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Yes, he actually talks to people through a voice on his smartphone. He hasn't been employed by anyone to do this \u00ad- he just claims he wants to keep the city's streets cleaner. We could call him a grime fighter armed with a dustpan and brush!</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Very good - a 'grime fighter' - someone fighting dirt and dust!</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Anyway, time now to see if your superpowers helped you answer today's question correctly.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Yes Rob, you asked me what year Superman first appeared in a comic book.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>And you said 1934 and you were wrong. Superman first appeared in Action Comics #1 in June 1938. The character was created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster and originally he wasn't a hero but a villain - the bad guy - but he was changed into a hero before he was published in the comic.</p>, <p>Now before you change into your costume, could you save the day by reminding us of some of the words we have heard today?</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Yes, today we heard:</p>, <p>superhero</p>, <p>superpowers</p>, <p>fictional</p>, <p>extraordinary</p>, <p>life-savers</p>, <p>admire</p>, <p>mission</p>, <p>honourable</p>, <p>closely-guarded</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Well, that brings us to the end of today's 6 Minute English.

So, here is today's question, Finn.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>OK, go ahead.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>According to the World Health Organisation, there are more than 4,000 chemicals in cigarette smoke. How many of these are known to be harmful to our health? Is it at least:</p>, <p>a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 50</p>, <p>b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 150</p>, <p>c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 250</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Mm \u2026 Let me think. (he guesses)?</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>You'll get the answer at the end of the programme. Well, electronic cigarettes are everywhere now. Some estimates say more than a million people are using e-cigarettes just in the UK. But these devices might not be very safe for secondary smokers \u2026</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Is that so? I thought they were okay because they produce vapour rather than the smoke full of harmful chemicals you get in ordinary cigarettes.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Well, the World Health Organisation is not convinced e-cigarettes are any safer to secondary smokers. It has recommended a <strong>ban</strong> on the use of electronic cigarettes indoors and their sale to people under 18 years old.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>A ban? In other words, they don't want them to be permitted indoors anymore? I know that e-cigarettes work by heating liquid <strong>nicotine</strong> \u2013 this is the substance in tobacco which makes it addictive. It turns into vapour which is inhaled by the smoker. I thought because it was just vapour, it was okay for non-smokers!</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>It's vapour with some chemicals in it. And experts fear it could have similar effects to the smoke produced by ordinary cigarettes. Listen to what Professor John Ashton has to say. He's from the Faculty of Public Health here in the UK. Which words does he use to describe the use of e-cigarettes for an extended period of time?</p>, <p>\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>INSERT<br clear=\"none\">Professor John Ashton, from the Faculty of Public Health in the UK<br clear=\"none\"/></br></strong>There are scientists in America who've been studying second-hand effects of tobacco smoke who are raising these issues now about the e-cigarettes. And we really can't allow these things to get establishedbefore we know what the <strong>long-term </strong>effects are going to be.\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>He talks aboutlong-termeffects. He means that the constant use of e-cigarettes for an extended period of time might cause harm which we are not aware of yet.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>You can't light up a cigarette in a pub or bar anymore. It was the effect of people's cigarette smoke on other staff that led to the ban on ordinary cigarettes in Britain. Private companies and the authorities are keen not to risk bringing back any kind of smoking to closed spaces in public places.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>This is likely to annoymany smokers who have been moving to electronic cigarettes in an attempt to cut down on nicotine or even <strong>quit smoking</strong>.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Yes, many people want to quit smoking \u00ad \u2013 stop smoking \u2013 at once. And they find it easier to do this if they can use e-cigarettes. In the last few decades smokers have been feeling persecuted.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Yes, there's a lot of pressure for them to quit the habit.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Listen to what this smoker who uses e-cigarettes has to say.He's in a pub in Bristol. Which word does he use to talk about the harm certain things do to children?</p>, <p><strong>INSERT<br clear=\"none\">Male customer, Bristol pub<br clear=\"none\"/></br></strong>We react at absolutely everything in this world. What we'll gonna have eventually though is 'no drinking beer' in pubs because it's <strong>damaging </strong>for children to watch it happening.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>He uses the word 'damaging', meaning harmful. He complains that there's an <strong>overreaction</strong> to things like cigarettes and alcohol.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Yes. An 'overreaction' means responding to something in a way which is more forceful than required. He complained that one day the authorities might end up banning people from drinking alcohol in pubs. Pubs, as we know, are bars to which most customers go to drink alcohol.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>He is using some irony here.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Yes. The right to smoke or not smoke generates passionate debates. Smoking is bad for your health, but some people argue that eating junk food is bad too but it's still available all over the place.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Cigarettes are addictive and it's very difficult for people just to give them up.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>But here are some facts which might make people think again. I told you earlier in the programme that there are more than 4,000 chemicals in cigarette smoke. And I asked you how many of these are known to be harmful to health. The options were: at least 50, 150 or 250?</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>I said 250. Is it as many as that, Rob?</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>It is as many as that.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Wow!</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Yes, at least 250. Acording to the World Health Organisation website, it says that more than 50 chemicals in tobacco smoke are known to cause cancer. Any amount of second hand tobaco smoke is thought to be unsafe, and second hand smoke causes more that 600,000\u00a0early deaths per year. Well, as we are nearly the end of the programme, let's just remember some of the words we used today. Finn?</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>We heard:</p>, <p>cough</p>, <p>secondary smoker</p>, <p>ban</p>, <p>nicotine</p>, <p>long-term</p>, <p>quit smoking</p>, <p>damaging</p>, <p>overreaction</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Thanks Finn.

Welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm joined today by Neil.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Hello. Neil here. Excuse me I'm enjoying a bar of chocolate\u2026</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Where did you get that from?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>In the <strong>vending machine</strong> upstairs \u2013 that's the automatic machine with drinks and sweets \u2013 you put coins in it to release whatever you paid for.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Now, if it was up to some health professionals, you wouldn't see many of those machines around anymore.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>What? No more machines which offer you as many sweets as you like, no questions asked?</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Exactly. The World Health Organisation has recently proposed a cut in its recommendation for how much sugar we should have. They now say that it should be less than 5% of our<strong> calorie intake</strong>.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>A<strong> calorie </strong>is a unit that measures how much energy you get from food, and calorie intake is how many calories we eat in a period of time \u2013 say a day, for example.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Yes. So this might be it for sugar for you today, Neil.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Well, let me see\u2026 this bar of chocolate contains 215 calories! That's quite a lot, isn't it?</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>But life can be sweet even with less sugar, Neil. So today, we're going to talk about what should be done to help us eat less sugar and you'll learn words about food.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>But I like my sugar!</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Many people do. So let me ask you about how much they like it. Which country has the highest sugar consumption? Is it:</p>, <p>a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 China</p>, <p>b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 India</p>, <p>c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The United States</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>I think it's the United States.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Okay. Well, we'll have the answer at the end of the programme! Right, so let's talk about sugar. Health experts are looking for ways to make us eat less of it.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>We all know that too much sugar can cause not only obesity and diabetes but also <strong>tooth decay</strong> \u2013 this destroys the hard surface of your teeth and exposes more sensitive parts. Ouch!</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Yes, it can be very painful. You might enjoy eating sweets but nobody likes <strong>toothache</strong> \u2013 that's what we call the pain in your teeth.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Experts say we should always brush our teeth after eating sugary food. \u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Yes. Aubrey Sheiham, Professor of Dental Public Health at University College London, goes even further. He is part of a team which is suggesting the authorities in England reduce the number of vending machines in public places. Listen to what he says. Which word does he use to describe Neil's chocolate bar and other kinds of wrapped sweets?</p>, <p><strong>INSERT<br clear=\"none\"/>Aubrey Sheiham, Professor of Dental Public Health at University College London<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>We shouldn't have vending machines with <strong>confectionery </strong>and <strong>soft drinks</strong> in any publicly-funded institutions \u2013 no schools, nurseries, hospitals etc. \u2013 and also limit the amount of sugar in school meals, nurseries' meals. That again would be a first step that one would take.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>He mentions 'confectionery', meaning chocolate and sweet snacks, which can be bought from vending machines, along with soft drinks \u2013 which are cold sweet drinks that are not alcoholic.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>The professor doesn't want these machines in state schools or hospitals. And he also wants meals served to children in schools to have less sugar.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>He's got a point there. We get used to sugar in childhood. And it seems that the more sugar we eat, the more we want. But if we get used to eating things which are less sweet, after a while when we eat something very sweet, it doesn't taste so good. Do you understand what I mean?</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Yes, I do. It's a matter of habit. We don't need so much sugar to enjoy the sweet taste. But the professor says there's another way of encouraging us to eat less sugar. Aubrey Sheiham talks about tax on sugar. France has already adopted a sugar tax. Where's the money being spent? Let's listen.</p>, <p><strong>INSERT<br clear=\"none\"/></strong><strong>Aubrey Sheiham, Professor of Dental Public Health at University College London<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>You've got a lot of public support in France where the consumption of sugar has gone down considerably. And, what is good about what the French have done is that tax that has gone on sugar is being spent in the <strong>health service</strong>. This is a way that you could actually use that money from the sugar tax and spend it on improving health care and dental care.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>He says it's being spent on the health service. This is the doctors' surgeries and hospitals financed with public money \u2013 money paid to a government in the form of taxes.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Oh, so chocolate might become more expensive! Not so good for me because I <strong>have a sweet tooth</strong>\u2026</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Ah a sweet tooth, yeah, like me \u2013 a strong preference for sweet food. Well, people with a sweet tooth should be careful or they might end up with toothache. \u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>I care a lot about my teeth.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Good on you. You've got a fine set of gnashers there. Okay, let's go back to our quiz. I asked you which country has the highest sugar consumption. The options were: China, India and the United States.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>And I said the United States.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>And Neil, you are wrong. The correct answer is actually India. According to a report issued by the US Department of Agriculture in 2012, India was the country with the highest consumption of sugar. Then we had China and the country in this list which ate the least amount of sugar is the United States.\u00a0 These countries are also amongst the largest producers of sugar. Okay. Well, now our time is up. Let's remember some of the words we explained today.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Yes. They were:</p>, <p>vending machine</p>, <p>calorie intake</p>, <p>calorie</p>, <p>tooth decay</p>, <p>toothache</p>, <p>confectionery</p>, <p>soft drinks</p>, <p>health service</p>, <p>to have a sweet tooth</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Thanks, Neil.

Welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm joined today by Finn. Hi Finn.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Hello Rob.\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Today we're talking about something we have some <strong>expertise</strong> in or knowledge about. That's teaching English.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>That's right Rob. We work on the BBC's Learning English website - hopefully giving people around the world <strong>a helping hand</strong> in learning a language that isn't the one they usually use.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Well hopefully we're about to make that learning journey a bit easier as we launch a brand new online course. But how long does it take someone to become a <strong>fluent</strong> speaker of English?</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>A good question Rob and one we'll try to answer today. We'll also be discussing some general ways to make learning English easier and explaining some learning-related vocabulary along the way. So let's get started Rob. \u00a0\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Hold your horses Finn \u2013 not so fast! I have a question to ask you first. According the last UK census taken in 2011, what percentage of the British population speaks a first language that is not English?</p>, <p>a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1.7%</p>, <p>b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 7.7%</p>, <p>c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 14.7%</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>That's an interesting one. My first guess is c) 14.7%.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>We'll find out if you are right or wrong later. So now we can discuss how learning English is getting easier. Of course there are a huge number of publications \u2013 books, leaflets and magazines \u2013 that can help teach you but there are those people who say that you can't beat the real thing \u2013 a teacher. Someone who can explain a language to you <strong>face-to-face</strong>. \u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Yes but that comes at a cost and isn't always practical \u2013 you might not have a school nearby. That's why in the 21st Century, online seems to be the main method of learning. Technology is allowing the English language to come to you!</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>That's true and that's why we've launched a brand new English course that's available on a computer, tablet or mobile phone. It's aimed at intermediate learners and charts a <strong>pathway</strong> through the various aspects of the language.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>We hope that by committing around 15 minutes a day to using it, a learner will see a real improvement in their English knowledge and skill. But as well as using the <strong>resources </strong>available online, how else can someone help themselves to get a better <strong>grasp</strong> \u2013 a better understanding - of English?</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Well if someone wants to become a confident speaker of English, trainer Richard Hallows has some tips. Have a listen and see if you can hear what are the two main aspects of English that you need.</p>, <p><strong>INSERT<br clear=\"none\">Richard Hallows \u2013 trainer in speaking English\u00a0<br clear=\"none\"/></br></strong>Most importantly, you've got to have\u00a0a a good range of vocabulary and grammar. You need to know lots of words, the more words you know the better, obviously. And similarly with grammar, the more grammar you have the better you can explain yourself. We also need to think about pronunciation - learners of English often worry about speaking like a native speaker\u2026 it's not necessary to have a native accent.<em>\u00a0</em></p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>OK, so Richard says you need a good range \u2013 or a wide variety - of vocabulary and grammar. The more words you know the more you can say \u2013 and the more grammar you know, the better you can say it\u2026</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Or even write it! One other tip is don't try to sound like a <strong>native</strong> \u2013 so someone who speaks English as a first language. All these are things we aim to cover in our new course.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Our new course might be a big help to you if you need English for your work, or if you're studying in English, or if you're planning to visit or even live in the UK. The British government expects immigrants to reach ESOL Entry 3 or B1 level, before they can be granted citizenship. It's equivalent to being able to hold a reasonably confident basic conversation.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Well in the UK it's estimated that you need around 360 hours of study to get to that stage from not knowing any English at all.\u00a0 But this depends on a number of factors such as <strong>motivation</strong> \u2013 how much you want to learn.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>And age can be a factor. Some experts say it's common for children under the age of 11 to be very immersed and be fluent in English in about six months. But why should someone choose to learn English? This is something we've been asking you on our Facebook page.<strong><br clear=\"none\"/></strong></p>, <p><strong>Finn \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Oussama says: \"It's like my passport.

I might be wrong.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>We'll find out if you're right or wrong later on. But now, here's another figure for you: In Europe, people throw away 100 million tonnes of food every year.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Wow, such a waste. Most of this food just ends up rotting in <strong>landfill sites</strong> and that adds to another problem \u2013 it creates greenhouse gases.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>It does. But the problem isn't just <em>us</em> throwing away <strong>leftovers </strong>in the fridge or cupboard, as we can hear now from BBC reporter Caroline Hepker. What are the other reasons that lead to food being wasted? \u00a0</p>, <p><strong>INSERT<br clear=\"none\"/></strong><strong>Caroline Hepker, BBC Reporter<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Typically, supermarkets demand that onions are about two to two-and-a-quarter inches in\u00a0diameter. This one will get pretty close to it but this one is too small, although it is perfectlyedible. The question is, what happens to it then? Food waste is a huge issue in America \u2013 40% of all food goes uneaten and it's a problem that starts long before you get to the\u00a0dining-room table.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Another staggering figure there Rob \u2013 40% of all food in America goes uneaten \u2013 it doesn't get eaten.And she explained that supermarkets are partly to blame.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Yes. We all love the <strong>convenience</strong>, the price and the choice of food that supermarkets offer \u2013 but a lot of food is binned \u2013 thrown out \u2013 long before it reaches the shelves.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>The reporter gave the example of onions: if they're the wrong size, they can't be sold; they're thrown away even though they\u2019re good enough to eat \u2013 or <strong>edible</strong>.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>There are many other types of fruit and vegetables that are <strong>discarded</strong> \u2013 or thrown away \u2013 because of their shape and size. And that's our fault really, because we often think food that looks good is better quality.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Another issue is the 'sell by' and 'use by' dates printed on food packaging. They confuse customers. Anything older than the 'sell by' date makes us think it\u2019s old and the food has <strong>gone off</strong>, but in fact this is just the date supermarket wants to sell it by.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>And there is another reason why some of us are encouraged to buy too much food. Have a listen to working mum, Tara Sherbrooke, about her shopping habits and see if you can hear what the problem is.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Also, see if you can hear what she does to try and minimise food waste.</p>, <p><strong>INSERT<br clear=\"none\"/></strong><strong>Tara Sherbrooke<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>I try very hard to meal-plan because as a working mum and having a busy family, I really try to make sure that there\u2019s enough food at the beginning of the week. I find it very difficult to walk pass two-for-one offers especially on things that we use. I even find it hard to walk past them when they're items I\u2019ve never purchased before \u2013 I stop and look!</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>So she is a busy working mum and she tries to meal-plan \u2013 she plans the family's meals for the week and works out what to buy.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>But she still gets tempted by the two-for-one offers. That's when you buy one item and you get another one of the same item for free.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Buy-one-get-one-free \u2013 or as it's sometimes known, <strong>BOGOF</strong>! You can get a bargain but it also means we sometimes buy too much of something. If it's fresh produce, it might go off before you get to use it all.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>But in other parts of the world people struggle to buy even the most basic food. A report by the UN's Food and Agricultural Organisation found that there is enough food for everyone, just a lot of inefficiency. So what can be done?</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Well things are being done. Apps and websites that <strong>distribute</strong> excess food are becoming more popular.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>And food banks are being set up too. These are charitable organisations people donate food to. It's then distributed to those who have difficulty buying their own food. And one trial project in New York requires the city's restaurants to stop sending food waste to landfills by 2015. But at the moment, globally, there's still a lot of food being thrown away. And Finn, I asked you how much? Is it 25%, 33% or 50% of all food produced?</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>I said half \u2013 50%.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>According to the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organisation, the answer is 33%. Still not good. It also found the amount of land needed to grow all the food wasted in the world each year would be the size of Mexico. Well, that brings us to the end of today's 6 Minute English.

It's that time of day when I need to <strong>nod off</strong> \u2013 or in other words, fall asleep.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Well, <strong>sleeping on the job</strong> \u2013 or sleeping at work - is no bad thing \u2013 and I hope today's programme will wake you up to the idea that sleeping in the workplace might be a good thing.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Oh really! That's good to hear. I would have thought that sleeping at work was against the rules.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Not in every office, Finn, and I'll tell you why soon as well as explaining some sleep-related vocabulary. But now you're wide awake, how about a question?</p>, <p><strong>Finn\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br clear=\"none\"/></strong>OK, let's hear it.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>When the former British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, was in power, she did her job with very little sleep. Do you know how many hours of sleep she is said to have had each night?</p>, <p>a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Three hours</p>, <p>b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Four hours</p>, <p>c)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Five hours</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>I always thought she got by, she managed her job, with just four hours of sleep a night.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Not much, is it? We'll find out if you are right or wrong later. I'm not sure if she chose <em>not</em> to sleep for long or she just wasn't able to sleep for long. Someone who can't sleep is called an <strong>insomniac</strong>.\u00a0\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Finn\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br clear=\"none\"/></strong>And I'm certainly not an insomniac. I enjoy sleeping all night and some of the day too. And Rob, you said napping during the day is a good thing?</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>It's always nice to have a short sleep \u2013 or what I call <strong>40 winks</strong> \u2013 during the day, but when you're at work this can be a problem. \u00a0In some companies, like Google and the Huffington Post, workplace naps are positively encouraged. They're seen as a way to make staff more productive.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>So you mean they work harder and are more creative because a <strong>power-nap</strong> \u2013 a quick sleep \u2013 makes workers feel refreshed and more alert. I like the sound of this!</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>An Australian health writer called Thea O'Connor, is a founder of a campaign called Nap Now which is trying to make sleeping at work more acceptable.\u00a0 She calls herself a '<strong>naptivist</strong>'! Let's hear from her now. What does she say is stopping us from doing this?</p>, <p><strong>Thea O'Connor, health writer and speaker:\u00a0\u00a0<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>I think that our culture is a bit crazy not to embrace it, and one of the reasons we don't is our attitude, you know it's quite counter-cultural to do nothing in order to get ahead. I just really see that it's time to disrupt the prevailing work ethic which is all about work longer and harder.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Right, so she wants us to embrace \u2013 to accept \u2013 the idea of a workplace power-nap. But it is our <strong>attitude</strong> \u2013 the way we think about work \u2013 that stops society from accepting this.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Yes, she explains that it is <strong>counter-cultural</strong> \u2013 so going against the normal way of thinking \u2013 to actually do nothing and have a snooze.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>That's why she is trying to change \u2013 or disrupt \u2013 our current <strong>work ethic</strong> of working longer and harder. She believes this doesn't necessarily bring better results. But Rob, is this idea just a fad \u2013 something that's popular for a short while?</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Maybe, but research has certainly shown that good quantity and quality of sleep is important for our <strong>wellbeing</strong>. A few years ago research by the East of England Development Agency found 30% of people have their best ideas in bed compared to just 11% who have them at their desk. It called for companies to install beds in the workplace.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Well, there aren't any in our office yet Rob. I think putting beds or areas for naps in the office would help us workers feel more able to rest and recharge our minds.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>An alternative idea would be to change our working hours. The UK's Sleep Council claims the <strong>nine-to-five</strong> work culture does not fit into the natural sleeping pattern of the human race and bosses need to introduce a more sleep-friendly working day.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>That sounds like a <strong>siesta</strong> to me - a short period of sleep in the middle of the day that people in warm places like Spain often have.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>My problem with a siesta is that if I have a sleep in the afternoon I'd never wake up!</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Well before you nod off now Rob, could you please tell me the answer to today's question.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Yes. I asked you if you knew how many hours of sleep the former British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, is said to have had each night?\u00a0 Three, four or five hours?</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>I said four hours Rob.</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>You are right. It has often been said she needed just four hours of sleep \u2013 only on weekdays, not weekends. Well before you have another power-nap, could you remind us of some of the vocabulary we've heard today:</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Yes, we heard:</p>, <p>napping</p>, <p>nod off</p>, <p>sleeping on the job</p>, <p>insomniac</p>, <p>40 winks</p>, <p>power-nap</p>, <p>naptivist</p>, <p>attitude</p>, <p>counter-cultural</p>, <p>work ethic</p>, <p>wellbeing</p>, <p>nine-to-five</p>, <p>siesta</p>, <p><strong>Rob<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Thanks.

I'll give you the answer at the end of the programme.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>So the idea of celebrity seems very modern in some ways \u2013 does it have a long history?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Well, Lord Byron, a very famous English poet born in 1788, is considered by some experts to be the world's first modern-style celebrity. Let's hear Dr Corin Throsby, English Literature researcher at Cambridge University.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Why was Byron a celebrity?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Listen out for the noun she uses in the first sentence meaning a product, or something for sale.</p>, <p><strong>INSERT<br clear=\"none\"/></strong><strong>Dr Corin Throsby, Cambridge University<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>If we think of celebrity as the moment where someone's personality becomes a <strong>commodity</strong>. So, for Byron the fact that he was popular on this scale that had never been achieved before because his career had coincided with mass printing. But something more than that, that there was a sort of a secondary industry of Byron stuff, you know, that there were Byron neck ties, people wanted to look like Byron. There was this mass of people that loved him. He could no longer control his <strong>image</strong>. I think that's what separates celebrity from the fame that had preceded that.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>So the noun was 'a commodity'. She said that when someone's personality becomes a product, that's when they turn into a celebrity. <strong>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </strong></p>, <p><strong>Neil<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>She talked of fame so big you can't control your own image<strong> \u2013 </strong>that's your reputation, the way other people think about you and imagine you. Someone interesting in this respect is Justin Bieber.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Yeah. Are you a fan, Neil?</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>I'm a massive fan of Justin Bieber. I love him.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>I believe you.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>He's a big name and he's always in the newspapers. His fans are called 'Beliebers'\u2026</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>and Byron's fans were called 'Byron maniacs'. That's the name his wife gave his adoring fans. Though she wasn't too happy about them. \u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Yes. Byron's life was full of <strong>scandals</strong>, actions which cause shock and disapproval among people.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>And for Byron it was mainly his love life. He had affairs with men and women.\u00a0</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>For Justin Bieber it's about his behaviour. He was accused of driving after drinking alcohol, and of <strong>vandalism</strong>.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Vandalism means causing damage to property.</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Poor Justin Bieber!</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Though he's very popular - his career started when he was in his early teens and I think it must have been difficult growing up with this global fame. Still, I wonder how much his autograph is worth in the current market\u2026</p>, <p><strong>Neil<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Well,I don't know about Justin Bieber's autograph but I do know about Michael Jackson's shiny glove. It became iconic in the 1980s, but how much was it sold for? Was it US$ 150,000; US$ 250,000 or c) US$ 350,000?</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>I said c) US$ 350,000.<strong>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </strong></p>, <p><strong>Neil<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>And you were right.</p>, <p><strong>Finn<br clear=\"none\"/></strong>Wow!

You know Rob, even I sometimes dream of something a bit more exciting like being a professional diver or maybe even a pilot of a really fast plane.</p>, <p><strong>Rob</strong></p>, <p>Well, guess what: even pilots get bored, you know?</p>, <p><strong>Finn</strong></p>, <p>Not when they are flying anyway.</p>, <p><strong>Rob</strong></p>, <p>Wrong. When they're up in the air!</p>, <p><strong>Finn</strong></p>, <p>No way! Really? I don't believe you!</p>, <p><strong>Rob</strong></p>, <p>Well, Missy Cummings, an American, was a fighter pilot. Listen to the phrasal verb she uses meaning to stop being bored, at least for a while. Is there ever time for a fighter pilot to get bored?</p>, <p><strong>Missy Cummings, former fighter pilot:</strong></p>, <p>Oh my gosh, sure, for the same reasons that commercial pilots get bored. These fighter jets are very automated when it comes to just holding altitude and heading. So you turn everything in autopilot and I probably listened to more Oprah Winfrey TV shows on the high-frequency radios\u2026 And so you get good about using the technology to figure out how to stave off that boredom.</p>, <p><strong>Finn</strong></p>, <p>Ah, so she listened to a show hosted by the American presenter Oprah Winfrey on the radio to stave off her boredom. Now, to stave off means to stop or to keep an unpleasant feeling away. In this case she means boredom.</p>, <p><strong>Rob</strong></p>, <p>Yes, indeed.</p>, <p>But some experts think there's something good about feeling bored.</p>, <p><strong>Finn</strong></p>, <p>Really?</p>, <p><strong>Rob</strong></p>, <p>Let's hear what Tiffany Watt-Smith has to say. She works for the Centre for the History of Emotions at the Queen Mary University of London. Pay attention to the word she uses to describe what boredom does to people.</p>, <p><strong>Tiffany Watt-Smith, Queen Mary University of London:</strong></p>, <p>On the one hand people are worried about being under-occupied and bored. On the other there's a set of anxieties about us having any more downtime, you know. We can constantly check our phones at the bus stop. Everything is to be filled and what does that do to our minds? I think boredom is a very useful emotion. It's an emotion which spurs people on to change something about their environment. If you're bored that gives rise to creativity.</p>, <p><strong>Finn</strong></p>, <p>So boredom spurs people on to change something. To spur on means to stimulate or to encourage someone to do something.</p>, <p><strong>Rob</strong></p>, <p>So what are you going to do, Finn? How will you change your life?</p>, <p><strong>Finn</strong></p>, <p>Change my life? Okay. Two things. The first one is: I want to know if I got that question right!</p>, <p><strong>Rob</strong></p>, <p>Well I said at the beginning of the programme that the longest continuous dramatic performance was held in New Jersey, US, in 2010. And I asked you how long was the cast on stage for to play The Bald Soprano by Eugene Ionesco.</p>, <p><strong>Finn</strong></p>, <p>Yes. The options were 8 hours, 17 hours and 23 hours, I think. And I said 17. Was I right?</p>, <p><strong>Rob</strong></p>, <p>You were not!</p>, <p><strong>Finn</strong></p>, <p>Oh, no!</p>, <p><strong>Rob</strong></p>, <p>It was even longer.</p>, <p><strong>Finn</strong></p>, <p>Wow! 23!</p>, <p><strong>Rob</strong></p>, <p>According to the Guinness Book of Records, the play lasted 23 hours, 33 minutes and 54 seconds. It was achieved by The 27 O'Clock Players who performed The Bald Soprano at Belmar, New Jersey, USA, on 27 July 2010. Anyway Finn, what's the second thing you're going to do to stave off your boredom?</p>, <p><strong>Finn</strong></p>, <p>You know what, Rob? I'm going to book myself a fantastic holiday! Maybe I could start with a visit to Patagonia in Argentina to see the penguins\u2026</p>, <p><strong>Rob</strong></p>, <p>Yeah, it sounds very exciting. But before you head off to Patagonia, could you remind us of some of the English words we've heard today?</p>, <p><strong>Finn</strong></p>, <p>We heard:</p>, <p>yawn</p>, <p>stimulating</p>, <p>restless</p>, <p>to cope with</p>, <p>stuck in a rut</p>, <p>to stave off</p>, <p>to spur on</p>, <p><strong>Rob</strong></p>, <p>Thanks Finn. That's it for this programme. I hope you didn't find it boring.</p>, <p><strong>Finn</strong></p>, <p>Not at all. I loved it!</p>, <p><strong>Rob</strong></p>, <p>Please join us soon again for 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English.</p>, <p><strong>Both</strong></p>, <p>Bye.</p>, <p>\u00a0</p>]", "transcriptTitle": "Transcript", "vocabularyDetail": "[<p><strong>to yawn -\u00a0</strong>to open your mouth wide and take air in and out slowly; usually a sign of boredom or tiredness</p>, <p><strong>stimulating -\u00a0</strong>making someone excited and interested in something</p>, <p><strong>restless -\u00a0</strong>unable to sit still because you are bored or worried</p>, <p><strong>to cope with -\u00a0</strong>to deal with a situation successfully</p>, <p><strong>stuck in a rut -\u00a0</strong>become too fixed in one kind of job or situation in life</p>, <p><strong>to stave off -\u00a0</strong>to stop or keep away an unpleasant feeling</p>, <p><strong>to spur on -\u00a0</strong>to encourage someone to do something</p>, <p>\u00a0</p>]", "vocabularyTitle": "Vocabulary"}]
