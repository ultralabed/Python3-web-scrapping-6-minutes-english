Was it:</p><p>a) 1970s<br/>b) 1950s<br/>c) 1920s</p><p>Listen to the programme to find out the answer.</p>,This week's question:,"In this programme we discuss risk and how different people react to different levels of risk in different ways. We hear from an expert who describes the different types of risk takers and how knowing your risk type can help people such as financial advisors, make decisions for you.", 31 May 2018,"<p><em>Note: This is not a word for word transcript</em></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Hello, and welcome to 6 Minute English, I'm Neil and joining me today is Rob.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Hello.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So Rob, what's the most dangerous thing you've ever chosen to do?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Mmm. Tricky question. I've done many risky things, but probably the most risky thing is bungee jumping in New Zealand.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Oh wow, bungee jumping. You'd never catch me doing that. Did you enjoy it?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Not really, no. I won't do it again!</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>OK, well today our topic is risk and how different people react to different levels of risk in different ways. For example, would you be happy to be in a driverless car?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Absolutely not! No, I don't trust anybody's driving - even a computer. So no, I wouldn't go in a driverless car.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>OK, I won't offer you a lift! Driverless cars are the topic of today's quiz. The question is: When was the first driverless car demonstrated on a public road? Was it:</p><p>a)    1970s  </p><p>b)    1950s</p><p>c)    1920s</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>I think they are quite modern, so I'm going to say 1970s.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>OK, well we'll find out if you're right at the end of the programme. Joe Kable is an Associate Professor of Psychology at the University of Pennsylvania. In a recent BBC science programme, All in the Mind, he talked about the psychology of risk and whether there was anything physically in our brains that could predict how much risk we are prepared to accept. Here he is, first talking about a number of different ways people see risk. How many different types does he describe?</p><p><strong>Joe Kable, </strong><strong>Associate Professor of Psychology, University of Pennsylvania<br/></strong>Some people are quite <strong>risk-averse</strong> and really don't want to take any decisions where there's risk involved at all, whereas others are fairly <strong>risk-tolerant</strong> and in some cases even <strong>risk-seeking </strong>so they seek out decisions that have an aspect of risk to them.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>How many different types of people did he mention, when it comes to attitudes to risk?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well, there were three. The first group was those who are <strong>risk-averse</strong>. If you are <strong>averse</strong> <strong><em>to</em></strong> something, you are against it, you don't like it. So <strong>risk-averse</strong> people don't like to take risks.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>The second group are those who are <strong>risk-tolerant</strong>.If you are <strong>tolerant</strong> <strong>of </strong>something, you accept it, you don't mind it, it's not a problem for you. So someone who is <strong>risk-tolerant</strong>is not worried by an element of risk in what they choose to do.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>The third group he mentioned are those who are <strong>risk-seeking</strong>. If you <strong>seek</strong> something, you actively look for it, you try to find it. So <strong>risk seekers</strong> are those who enjoy risk and want to take risks in their life.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Associate Professor Kable carried out research on risk-taking and discovered that there were differences in brain structure and the way parts of the brain worked together between those who are <strong>risk-averse</strong> and those who are <strong>risk-tolerant</strong> or <strong>risk seekers.</strong></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>So it seems as if this is something that could be measured. You could put someone in a brain scanner and tell if they like risk or not. I wonder how useful that would be though – is there any practical application for this knowledge?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Good question and one that was put to Kable. What area does he say this could be applied to?</p><p><strong>Joe Kable<br/></strong>Definitely something that I can see coming out of this is using these associations to help develop better assessments of who's likely to take risks versus not. This is exactly the thing that <strong>financial advisors</strong> want to assess when you come to them and say 'I want <strong>to put my money away</strong> for <strong>retirement'</strong>. Exactly the aspect of your personality that they want to know is what's your tolerance for taking risk?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>In which area does he say knowledge of someone's attitude to risk might be useful?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Financial planning. He says that financial advisors, who are people that give advice on what to do with our money, would find this information very useful. It would help them <strong>to assess </strong>what to do with your money, which means it would help them to decide, to make an intelligent decision about your money in certain situations.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>For example if you are planning for your <strong>retirement</strong>. <strong>Retirement</strong> is the time when are able to or you have to stop working.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>He also used an interesting expression there, to <strong>put your money away</strong>, which means 'save your money', 'put it somewhere where you can't spend it and where it can grow'. You know I think my financial planner could just ask me about how I feel about risk rather than giving me a brain scan. I heard brain scans can be risky!</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Mmm, not sure that's true but anyway, what is true is the answer to this week's quiz question. I asked you when the first driverless car was demonstrated on a public road.  The options were a) the 1970s, b) the1950s and c) the 1920s. What did you say Rob?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>I said the 1970s.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And you were wrong, I'm afraid. Apparently it was the 1920s, so a long time ago. Well done if you got that right. Now before we drive off into the sunset, let's recap today's vocabulary.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes right, first we had three words describing different attitudes to risk. There was <strong>risk-averse</strong>, for people who don't like risk.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>People who don't mind risk are <strong>risk-tolerant</strong>.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And people who like risk and want risk are <strong>risk seekers</strong>.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Next we had the verb <strong>to assess</strong>. This means 'to make a judgement or a decision based on information'.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>A phrase meaning 'to save money' is <strong>to put money away</strong>.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And finally we had <strong>retirement</strong>. That time of life when you are too old to work anymore or you have enough money that you don't need to work anymore. Are you looking forward to your <strong>retirement </strong>Rob?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Cheeky. I'm neither old enough nor rich enough to even think about that Neil.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Same here. Well that's all from us today, and you don't have to be a risk seeker to find us on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube, and of course on our website bbclearningenglish.com!

I'm Neil.<strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And hello. I'm Rob. </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So Rob, you are a man who enjoys travel. What’s the furthest journey you’ve ever made? </p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well, I have been to the other side of the world. I've been to Australia, New Zealand – so from London that's a very long way. </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And how was it? </p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well, it was pretty boring really and quite cramped on the aeroplane – but I loved it when I got there. </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So how would you feel about a journey of 56 million kilometres that took around nine months? </p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Right. I'd have to travel Business Class, I think - lots of movies and a very comfortable seat! </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, that’s how long it would take to get to the planet Mars and this programme is all about the women who want to be the first to set foot on the red planet. First, though, today’s question, which is about the size of Mars. Is it …     </p><p>a)    Bigger than Earth       <br/>b)    About the same size as Earth, or<br/>c)    Smaller than Earth</p><p><strong>Rob<br/> </strong>I’m pretty sure I know this. It’s bigger than Earth, much bigger I think. </p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/> Well, we’ll find out if you’re right at the end of the programme. It’s been 40 years since NASA first recruited women to be astronauts. Today, a third of the people who work at NASA are women. </p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/> Yes, and 2016 was the first year that there were an equal number of women and men joining as astronaut trainees. </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Equality is slowly coming but only men have had the opportunity to walk on the Moon, although that was over 45 years ago. Karen Nyberg is one of NASA’s current astronauts. In a recent BBC News feature she talked about her hopes. When did she join the astronaut programme? </p><p><strong>Karen Nyberg, NASA Astronaut<br/></strong>When I was <strong>selected</strong> as an astronaut in the year 2000 I thought that that might be <strong>a realistic possibility</strong>, that we would be the ones, the next to go to the Moon. So it's <strong>unfortunate</strong> that we weren't. </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>When did she become an astronaut? </p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well, she said that she was <strong>selected</strong> in 2000. '<strong>Selected' </strong>means chosen. </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>At that time, when she was <strong>selected</strong>, she thought going to the Moon would be <strong>a realistic possibility</strong>. So she thought that it wasn’t just a dream, but something that could happen. There was a good chance it would happen. </p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>However, she was disappointed because that opportunity didn’t arrive at that time. She describes that as being <strong>unfortunate</strong>. In this sense '<strong>unfortunate'</strong> means unlucky. If you use this adjective it means you are disappointed about something, but you do perhaps understand the reason for it. </p><p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>So far, a woman hasn’t had the opportunity to step on the Moon. These days Mars is the big target for space travel. There are many problems to overcome, but could it, should it be a woman who is the first person to take that step?<strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Rob<br/> </strong>Absolutely, why not? On a mission to Mars there would be need for many different kinds of specialists. We tend to think of astronauts as spaceship pilots, but really I think they are much more like scientists, carrying out different experiments. </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>If we are going to set up a base on Mars, one thing that would be very important is to try to find a way of growing food. For that you need people with skills in those areas. One person with those skills is Gioia Massa, a Life Science project manager for NASA. Now you would think that being a top scientist she would be brilliant at all areas or <strong>aspects</strong> of the job, but she told BBC News that it wasn’t always the case. What two <strong>aspects </strong>does she mention she wasn’t good at? </p><p><strong>Gioia Massa, Life Science project manager for NASA<br/></strong>There certainly were <strong>aspects</strong> where I was challenged, you know. I wasn't as great in <strong>math </strong>as some of my colleagues, my handwriting is terrible. So there are things that are not my <strong>strength</strong>. But then I fell in love with plants and plants were my <strong>strength</strong>, I really learned and focused on that. </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So Rob, what did she have problems with?<strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well, she said that she wasn’t good at <strong>math</strong>. '<strong>Math'</strong> is a North American English word for what in British English, we call maths. Both words mean mathematics, so '<strong>math' </strong>in American English, 'maths' in British English. </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>She also said that her handwriting is terrible! </p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Mind you, if her handwriting was really terrible, maybe nobody would be able to read her bad maths! </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Good point! So handwriting and maths aren’t or weren’t her <strong>strengths</strong>. They are not what she is good at. What <em>are</em> her <strong>strengths</strong>?<strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Rob<br/> </strong>Well, the thing she is good at, her real <strong>strengths</strong> are working with plants, so that’s what she concentrated on.<strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>Right. Well, let’s see if one of your <strong>strengths</strong> is the knowledge of the planets. Today’s quiz question was: Is Mars…</p><p>a)    Bigger than Earth<br/>b)    About the same size as Earth<br/>c)    Smaller than Earth</p><p>What did you say Rob? </p><p><strong>Rob<br/> </strong>I said that it was bigger, much bigger. </p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/> And the answer, I'm afraid to say, is that Mars is smaller than Earth, much smaller in fact. </p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/> Oh, well, I guess I won’t be <strong>selected</strong> to be an astronaut any time soon! </p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/> Before we blast off out of here, let’s review the vocabulary we covered today. The first word was the one you just mentioned, '<strong>selected'</strong>, meaning chosen. </p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Then we had the phrase, '<strong>a realistic possibility'</strong> to describe something that has a good chance of happening, unlike my astronaut application! </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, if you did become an astronaut, that would be <strong>unfortunate</strong>, our next word, for me at least. </p><p><strong>Rob<br/> </strong>Unfortunate, you mean disappointing for you? </p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/> Well, if you were up in space I wouldn’t have the pleasure of your company. </p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/> Hashtag blushing. Our next word was '<strong>aspects</strong>'meaning parts of something and then the Americanisation, '<strong>math</strong>'. </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Which we call maths, or mathematics in British English. And finally we had '<strong>strengths</strong>'. And maths certainly isn’t one of my <strong>strengths</strong> – it’s not something I’m good at. </p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>But one of your <strong>strengths</strong> is saying nice things about people. </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Hashtag double blush. Well, time for us to go – not to Mars, but to lunch!

There's nothing like it, is there? The action, the drama, the atmosphere! Except that football fans don't seem to be singing as much as they used to and some managers are complaining it's having a negative effect on the players! So why is this happening? Follow Dan and Neil to find out and learn six related pieces of vocabulary.", 17 May 2018,"<p><em>Note: This is not a word for word transcript</em><strong><br/></strong></p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Dan.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I'm Neil.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Now, Neil, do you like going to live football matches?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Oh yes, I love it.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Is it better than watching them on TV?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, you don’t really see as much as you do on TV, but then on TV you don’t really feel the atmosphere. You can’t sing along with the chants and songs at home.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Well, it’s good you mentioned the songs and chants because that is today’s topic. It seems that for some football clubs, the atmosphere in the stadiums is becoming a bit ‘quiet’. Now, before we look at this topic in more detail, here is today’s quiz. As we are talking about football, in which decade was the first ever international football played?</p><p>a)    in the 1870s<br/>b)    in the 1890s<br/>c)    in the 1910s</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I could be wrong but I think it was before the turn of the century, so I’ll say the 1890s.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Well, we'll see if you're right or not later in the show. Now, songs and chants are part of the experience of football matches. But where do they come from? What are they about? Here’s Joe Wilson from BBC Sport. Which team name does he mention?</p><p><strong>Joe Wilson<br/></strong>Some songs can be <strong>witty</strong>, <strong>honed</strong> specifically to celebrate a certain player or moment in a club’s history. Others rely more on <strong>a hypnotic repetition</strong> of syllables. U-NI-TED, for example.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>So, which team does he mention?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, he used the syllables from United. This isn’t one team as there are quite a few professional teams in Britain that have United in their names, in fact there are over a dozen. Perhaps the most well-known though would be Manchester United.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>I think fans of Welling United might argue with you about that! Anyway, what did Wilson say about the nature of football songs?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>He said they could be <strong>witty</strong>. <strong>Witty </strong>means funny but in a clever way. He also said that they could be <strong>honed</strong>.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong><strong>Honed</strong> is an interesting word here. Something that is <strong>honed</strong> is carefully crafted, skilfully created and developed over a period of time.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>When it comes to <strong>witty</strong> football songs Wilson describes them as being <strong>honed</strong> to be about a particular player, or a moment in a club’s history. But these aren’t the only kinds of songs. Another kind of song he describes is the <strong>hypnotic </strong>repetition of syllables.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Something that is <strong>hypnotic </strong>repeats again and again – like a magical spell or chant. What’s interesting is that in football songs words can have more syllables than you would expect.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Oh yes, for example, let’s take England. Two syllables, right?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Right!</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Wrong! At least in a football stadium it becomes three syllables. Eng – ger – land, Eng – ger – land …</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Alright! Thank you! Let’s listen to Mr Wilson again.</p><p><strong>Joe Wilson<br/></strong>Some songs can be <strong>witty</strong>, <strong>honed</strong> specifically to celebrate a certain player or moment in a club’s history. Others rely more on <strong>a hypnotic repetition</strong> of syllables. U-NI-TED, for example.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Now, apparently, in many stadiums, the crowds aren’t singing as much as they used to. Some managers have complained that the fans are too quiet and that this has a negative effect on the players. So what are some of the reasons for this? Here’s BBC Sport’s Joe Wilson again. How many reasons does he mention?</p><p><strong>Joe Wilson<br/></strong><strong>The decline in</strong> singing may be explained by changing <strong>demographics</strong> in football attendance. Older supporters, more expensive tickets. Or by stadium design. All-seater arenas may <strong>discourage</strong> the instinct to stand up and sing.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>So, what reasons did he give for the<strong> decline </strong>in singing, for the fact that singing is getting less common.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>He gave a number of reasons. He talked about the change in <strong>demographics</strong>. <strong>Demographics</strong> refers to a section of the population that do a particular thing. It can refer to age groups or wealth, for example.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>What Wilson says is that the members that make up a football crowd are changing. They are older and wealthier, and perhaps that is a <strong>demographic</strong> or group that is less likely to sing in public.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Another reason he gives is that sitting down might also <strong>discourage </strong>people from singing. If something <strong>discourages </strong>you, it makes you not want to do it. Most stadiums in the UK have to have seats and maybe singing is something that people feel happier doing when they are standing up.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Well the final whistle is about to blow on today’s programme. Before that though, here’s the answer to our quiz question. I asked you when the first international football match took place.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I took a guess with the 1890s.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>And that's a red card, I'm afraid, Neil. The first international football match took place in the 1870s between England and Scotland.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Oh, come on ref!</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>And now, to take us to the whistle, let's review today’s vocabulary.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>The first word we had was <strong>witty</strong>. A kind of humour that is smart and clever.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Then we had <strong>honed </strong>for something that is crafted and improved over time. A bit like my physique. I’ve been <strong>honing</strong> my body in the gym.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Really? Are you being <strong>witty</strong>?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>I wasn’t trying to! Anyhow, we then heard about <strong>hypnotic </strong>repetition to describe the effect of thousands of people repeating the syllables of a football team over and over and over and over and over and over and over…</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>OK, Dan! OK, Dan! We use the phrase <strong>a decline in </strong>to say that something is getting less.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong><strong>Demographics</strong> refers to a group or section of the population that is involved a particular activity.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And finally we had the verb <strong>discourage</strong> for something that makes us less likely to do something.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Well, that is it for this programme. If you’re not interested in football, I hope we didn’t <strong>discourage</strong> you from listening again!</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Indeed, I hope it doesn’t lead to <strong>a decline in</strong> our audience. We want to have as wide a <strong>demographic</strong> as possible.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>So with that in mind, don't forget to find us on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube, and of course, on our website – bbclearninenglish.com!

I'm Neil.</p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/>Hello. I'm Dan. Neil, aren't you going to say the 'welcome to 6 Minute English' bit?</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Hmmm maybe. How's your mood today, Dan? Feeling happy?</p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/>Oh yes, very happy. I’ve just had lunch. What about you?</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Well to be honest, I haven’t had the chance to eat yet and it’s making me a bit grumpy.</p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/>Why haven’t you eaten?</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Well, I was doing some research for today’s topic which is all about feeling angry when you are hungry. You know what I’m talking about?</p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/>Oh yes, we’re talking about being ‘hangry’. It’s quite a new word, isn’t it? A combination of hungry and angry.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Yes, hangry is our topic. But before we learn more about it, here’s today’s quiz. English has quite a few words which are made by joining two different words together like ‘hangry’, for example: brunch, motel, Brexit. What do we call these words? Are they…<br/><br/>a) Suitcase words<br/>b) Portmanteau words, or<br/>c) Backpack words</p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/>Well, I think I know this one, so I’ll keep the answer to myself - don’t want to give away any spoilers. What I do want to know is if hanger is a real thing – or is it just something that’s been made up by grumpy people, like you?</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Let’s hear from Sophie Medlin, who is a lecturer in nutrition and dietetics at King’s College London. Is hangar a real thing and where does the word come from?</p><p><strong>Sophie Medlin</strong><br/>We’ve long recognised that hunger leads to irritability - in science. But the wonderful world of social media has merged the two words for us and now we know it as hanger.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>So, is hangar a real thing and where does she say the word comes from?</p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/>According to Medlin it is a real thing. She says that science has recognised that hunger leads to irritability. Irritability is a noun which means being easily annoyed, not in a good mood.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>And she says that it was the wonderful world of social media that joined the two words together. She used the verb merge. Merge, meaning join together.</p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/>I know social media is responsible for many things, but the word hangry actually appeared in the 1990s – so a little before the arrival of social media. But it’s certainly true that social media has made it more prominent.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Me, right now, hashtag hangry! Let’s listen to that clip again.</p><p><strong>Sophie Medlin</strong><br/>We’ve long recognised that hunger leads to irritability - in science. But the wonderful world of social media has merged the two words for us and now we know it as hanger.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>So now we know that hangar is a real thing, let’s learn a bit more about it. Why does it happen? Why do we get angry when we are hungry? Here’s Sophie Medlin again.</p><p><strong>Sophie Medlin</strong><br/>As the blood sugars drop, we increase our cortisol and adrenalin – so our kind of fight or flight hormones – and those have an impact on our brain and the neuropeptides – the things that control our brain, the chemicals in our brain, the ones the trigger for hunger are the same ones that trigger for anger and also for rage and impulsive type behaviours. So that’s why you get that sort of same response.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>So it’s all to do with blood sugar, isn’t it?</p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/>Yes, it seems so. When we are hungry the level of sugar in our blood is lower and this causes an increase in particular hormones. Hormones are the chemicals we make in our bodies that control certain biological and psychological functions.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>The hormones released when we are hungry are the same as our fight or flight hormones. They are the hormones that the body uses to prepare us to either fight or run away from a dangerous situation.</p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/>When these hormones are increased, it can cause anger and rage. Rage is another word for being very angry.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>And when we are angry we can behave impulsively. Impulsive behaviour is when we do things without thinking, without considering the consequences.</p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/>So when we are hungry, the same emotions can run through us. We can be angry and make poor decisions. And that is hanger.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Which brings us nicely to our quiz question. What do we call words, like hanger, that are made by joining two different words together? Now you said you knew the answer Dan?</p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/>I did!</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>What was it?</p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/>Portmanteau words.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>And you are absolutely correct. The answer is portmanteau words. Congratulations if you knew that.<br/><br/><strong>Dan</strong><br/>I did.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Alright then smarty pants. No need to boast!</p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/>I can see that you're still a bit hangry Neil.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Yes, I’m hungry and that is making me angry! But I think I can hold on to get through a review of the rest of today’s vocabulary.</p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/>Well, we also had the noun irritability, meaning getting annoyed very easily, just like…</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Don’t, just don’t. Or I might just merge my fist with your face.</p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/>Ouch. Yes, merge meaning join different things together. I can see your fight or flight hormones are kicking in. Those chemicals in the body that prepare us for aggression or escape.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>I haven’t quite reached rage yet. This was another of our words, rage, and it means a state of being very, very angry.</p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/>Our last word was impulsive. This is an adjective to describe when we do things without really thinking about them. We just do them without any control and without thinking about the consequences.<br/><br/><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Now I’m off, I’m starving. I’ve got to eat before I do something impulsive.

But do they know the affect the scents have on people around them. Listen to this discussion about smells and learn some useful vocabulary too., 03 May 2018,"<p><em>Note: This is not a word for word transcript</em></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Hello welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Neil.<strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>And I'm Dan.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>In this programme, we going to hear from someone who smells smells for a living. Although these are very expensive smells - smells that we wear deliberately to make us smell good.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/> </strong>Ah, you mean scents and perfumes?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes and perfumes are big business. And that is the topic of our quiz in this programme. How much is the perfume industry in the UK worth each year?</p><p>a)    £650 million</p><p>b)    £970 million</p><p>c)    £1.3 billion</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Well, I don't nose this – smell, nose - this is just a guess, but I’ll say £970 million.<strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, I’ll let you know the answer a little later in the programme. Now let’s hear from Roja Dove, who is a perfumer. He designs and creates very exclusive and very expensive perfumes. In a recent BBC video he talked about the power of smells. What does he say there is a very deep psychological connection between? </p><p><strong>Roja Dove<br/></strong>…who we are as a personality and the type of smells we like. When we are born, the part of our brain which deals with smell is empty so we learn our response to smell. And then when we smell that <strong>odorant</strong> again it’s like a <strong>trigger</strong> or a <strong>catalyst</strong> that will revive the original associational memory.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So Dan, what does he say there is a very deep psychological connection between?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Between our personality and the kind of smells we like. The point he is making is that the smells we experience when we are very young can have a big psychological impact on us even later in life.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I know that feeling – smell is a very powerful sense. The smell of something can take you right back in time and fill you with emotions.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Exactly. For example, when I walk through the perfume area of a department store I always feel a bit nostalgic because I can smell the perfume my mum first girlfriend used to wear. It’s a powerful sensation.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Dove used particular words and expression to describe this, didn’t he?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Yes, first he used the word <strong>odorant</strong> to describe the smell. It’s not really a common word. We use it more frequently as part of the word <strong><em>de</em></strong><strong>odorant</strong>, which is something we buy to cover up what we think of as the unpleasant natural smell of our bodies. These <strong>odorants</strong>, he said, can act as the <strong>trigger</strong> or <strong>catalyst </strong>for these memories. Both the nouns <strong>trigger</strong> and <strong>catalyst </strong>refer to something that causes a particular response. So a particular smell can be a <strong>trigger</strong> or <strong>catalyst</strong> for a particular emotion.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>As well as being a trigger for memories, smells can, according to Dove, say a lot about your personality. Here he is again talking about the kind of scent to wear if you want to give a particular impression. What does he say these scents make you appear very strong at?</p><p><strong>Roja Dove<br/></strong>The idea of the message you <strong>give off</strong> with scent I think can’t be underestimated. My suggestion would be to look for very, very woody, mossy, structured scents called Chypres if the message you want to put across is that you are someone <strong>not to be messed with</strong>, very, very strong in business, or whatever – just <strong>not to be messed with</strong>.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So what do the scents he described make you seem strong at?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Business, they can make you seem very, very strong in business.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Mmm, and how does he explain that?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Well, he says that some scents <strong>give off</strong> a particular message. The phrasal verb <strong>give off</strong> is often used to describe something that we broadcast about ourselves without saying anything. So he’s saying that our scent, our perfume, can <strong>give off</strong> a message about the kind of person we are and that we shouldn’t <strong>underestimate</strong> that. If you <strong>underestimate</strong> something you don’t give it as much importance as it should have, you don’t take it seriously enough.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>He then goes on to talk about the particular scent that <strong>gives off</strong> the impression of being very strong in business.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Yes, it’s a woody, mossy scent which suggests that you are <strong>not someone to be messed with</strong>.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong><strong>Not to be messed with</strong>?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Yes – someone to be taken seriously, someone who is serious who you don’t want to try and trick. </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Right and talking of tricking – did we trick you with the quiz? I asked - What was the value of the perfume industry in the UK?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>And I said it was £970 million.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And it was actually option c), which was an incredible £1.3 billion.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Wow! That is a lot of smelly stuff.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>It is indeed! Right, now, time for vocabulary recap. What words and expressions did we have today?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Well, first we had <strong>odorant – </strong>an unusual word for something that smells.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Then two words with a very similar meaning: a <strong>trigger</strong> and a <strong>catalyst</strong> – both of which refer to something that can make something else happen. In this case it was a particular smell making us remember something from the past. So scents can sends us to the past. But they can also say something about our personality.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Yes, they can send unspoken information -  or <strong>give off</strong> messages. And these messages should not be <strong>underestimated</strong>. If you do <strong>underestimate </strong>the importance of smell, it means that you don’t take those messages seriously.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And finally we heard the phrase <strong>to mess with someone</strong>. <strong>To mess with someone</strong> means that you don’t take them seriously, you cause them trouble and that may cause <em>you</em> trouble.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Well I certainly wouldn’t want <strong>to mess with</strong> you! Judging by the messages you’re <strong>giving off</strong>.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Ah you mean my aftershave? Makes me seem powerful?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>I was thinking more of the egg sandwich you had for lunch. I really wouldn’t <strong>underestimate</strong> the power of that.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Ah! On that note, I think it’s time to end the programme.

I'm Rob.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>And I'm Neil.</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>Can you remember the first time you ever used the World Wide Web or as we often call it, the internet, and what you used it for?</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Oh that's a good question. I do remember. And nothing really changes does it? Because I looked up pictures of cats!</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>Cats! Very useful, anyway do you think the internet has generally been positive or negative for the world?</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Wow, that's a big question. A huge question. I don't know if I can answer that.</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>Well one person who perhaps can answer it, is the man who invented it: British computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee. We'll find out what he thinks has become of his 'child' shortly but before that, a question for you all. When did Berners-Lee first suggest the idea for what would become the World Wide Web? Was it in...<br/>a) 1985<br/>b) 1989<br/>c) 1991</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Tricky but I think it's earlier than people think so I'm going to go for 1985.</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>Well that was a long time ago but we'll reveal the answer a little later in the programme. I think it's true to say that the internet has been one of, if not the most important technological developments perhaps of all time. Would you agree Neil?</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Well it's hard to imagine living without it. Not impossible, but not nearly as convenient.</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>These days we take the internet for granted. We share our lives on social media and not just with friends and family. And that isn't always a positive thing according to the father of the internet, Tim Berners-Lee. In a recent BBC Tech Tent programme he talked about his concerns with the internet and particularly the companies that control its information. Companies which he calls 'internet giants'. What does he say he thought these companies had to do?</p><p><strong>Tim Berners-Lee</strong><br/>Initially I felt the main thing an internet giant had to do was just to be neutral, just be a platform and humanity, once connected by technology, will do wonderful things. And clearly it doesn't work like that. If you connect humanity via Wikipedia then they do produce, in general, wonderful things. If you connect people by social network where they have anonymity, then it can bring out the very nastiest of people.</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>So what did he say he thought these internet giants had to do?</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>He said that he thought initially, that they just had to be neutral. Initially means 'at first', 'in the beginning' and it also suggests that later he changed his mind. Anyway, he said that he thought they just had to be neutral. Neutral here means that they didn't need to do anything, they didn't need to control the internet or information. He thought it would be a tool to connect people and ideas and information and it would be wonderful.</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>But it's not all good, is it?</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>No. He does say that giving people access to sources of information is generally a good thing but that when it comes to social networks, social media, people have anonymity.</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>Anonymity?</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Yes. It means that on the internet people can hide their true identity or personality. Some people write things that they would never say to someone in person because they think there will be no consequences. Berners-Lee says anonymity can bring out the nastiest side of people. People saying horrible and terrible things to each other.</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>Berners-Lee does have some suggestions for how this could be changed. And it's based on the idea of likes and shares, which he calls kudos. What's his suggestion?</p><p><strong>Tim Berners-Lee</strong><br/>The different social networks and different platforms are in different situations and in some cases they have acknowledged there is an issue. I think they realise that the issue could be hugely ameliorated by tweaking the way the thing works by changing the way retweets are propagated or changing the way people get kudos - give them more kudos for being constructive for example.</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>So how does he think companies could address the problem?</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Well, he says that some of the social networks have agreed that there is a problem and they know what could improve it.</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>He didn't use the word improve though, did he?</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>No he actually used the rather formal verb ameliorate, which means 'to improve or make something better'.</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>So how does he suggest the problem could be ameliorated?</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>By tweaking the way in which people give or receive kudos. Tweaking means 'making a small change to the way something works'. Much of what happens on the internet is driven by our desire to get likes and shares – this is the kudos that Berners-Lee talks about. He feels that tweaking this could lead to a better experience. For example, getting more kudos for constructive or positive actions.</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>Mmm, interesting – but I wonder who would decide if something is constructive?</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Well that's another big question for another day, I guess.</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>For now though, let's have the answer to our small question. In what year did Berners-Lee present the idea for what would become the World Wide Web? The options were a) 1985, b)1989 or c) 1991. It was infact 1989. Now before we go let's have a quick recap of today's vocabulary.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Initially – means 'at first - in the beginning'. Then we had neutral.</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>In this case it meant 'not controlling' or 'not taking any action to control'.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Then there was the noun anonymity which is the state of having a hidden identity or personality.</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>Next, to ameliorate a situation is to make it better.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>To tweak something is to make a small change to the way something works.</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>And then we had kudos. Kudos is praise and appreciation for something you've done.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Well kudos to you Rob for today's programme. Thank you very much.</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>Well, thank you Neil and thank you everyone for listening.

I'm Neil.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And I'm Rob.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Rob, when you were a child, did you have a pet?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes, we had a few pets. My favourite was a little fluffy hamster.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And what happened to your hamster?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well one day I got home from school and he wasn’t in his cage. I was worried for a bit in case he’d escaped or got hurt, but it was alright. My mum told me that he had gone to live on a farm so that he could run around with other animals.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Really?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes, really.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>A hamster. Went to live on a farm. To be with other animals. Really?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Oh, well, when you put it like that.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I think that was probably one of those lies that parents tell their children so as not to make them sad.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well I’m sad now</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well maybe having a go at this quiz will cheer you up. According to a study by a US psychologist, what percentage of people will lie in a typical ten minute conversation?</p><p>Is it:<br/>a)    40%</p><p>b)    50%, or</p><p>c)    60%?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>I think most people don’t lie that much, so I’ll say 40%.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>We’ll reveal the answer a little later in the programme.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>So today we are talking about lies and particularly the lies that parents tell children.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>The topic was discussed on the BBC Radio 4 programme, Woman’s Hour.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>A guest on that programme was Doctor Chris Boyle, a psychologist at Exeter University. He talks about a particular kind of lie. We tell these lies not because we want to hurt people. What colour are these lies called?</p><p><strong>Dr Chris Boyle<br/></strong>A <strong>white lie</strong> is just a <strong>distortion</strong> of the truth without <strong>malicious intent</strong> – as long as there's not <strong>malicious intent</strong> I think it's something that we do. It's almost a <strong>societal norm</strong> that it's become where it is acceptable that we do tell certain lies at certain times.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Dr Chris Boyle there. What colour is the kind of lie he was talking about?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>A <strong>white lie</strong>. He says a <strong>white</strong> <strong>lie</strong> is just a <strong>distortion </strong>of the truth. <strong>Distortion</strong> here means a changing or bending of the truth. These kind of lies are OK as long as we don’t tell them because we want to hurt someone.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>He used the phrase <strong>malicious intent </strong>to talk about a bad reason for doing something, didn’t he?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes, <strong>intent</strong> is the reason or purpose for doing something and <strong>malicious</strong> is an adjective which means cruel or nasty. So <em>without</em> <strong>malicious intent</strong> means without wanting to hurt or be cruel to someone.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>He said that this kind of <strong>white lie</strong> was almost a <strong>societal norm</strong>. Can you explain what he means by that?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes, something that is the <strong>norm </strong>is something that is expected, it’s regular and usual.The adjective <strong>societal </strong>comes from the noun society. So a <strong>societal norm</strong> is something that is regular and common in your culture or society.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So do you think your mum’s story about the hamster and the farm was a little white lie?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes, I’m sure it was. She didn’t do it with <strong>malicious intent</strong> - she didn’t want to hurt me. In fact, just the opposite, she wanted to protect me.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, that’s one kind of <strong>white lie </strong>that parents tell, to protect children. There are also a couple of other reasons. One being the parent’s convenience.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes, I remember my mum telling me on certain days, the park wasn’t open. I know now that it never closed, I guess at the time she was just too busy to take me.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And then there are the cultural lies that parents tell children.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>What do you mean by that?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well first, if you have any children listening to this right now, you might want to cover their ears for a few seconds. RobI’m talking about, for example, Father Christmas and the Tooth Fairy.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes, there’s no <strong>malicious intent </strong>in telling children those stories. It is a cultural and <strong>societal norm.</strong></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Let’s listen to Dr Chris Boyle again talking about <strong>white lies</strong>.</p><p><strong>Dr Chris Boyle <br/></strong>A <strong>white lie</strong> is just a <strong>distortion</strong> of the truth without <strong>malicious intent</strong> – as long as there's not <strong>malicious intent</strong> I think it's something that we do. It's almost a <strong>societal norm</strong> that it's become where it is acceptable that we do tell certain lies at certain times.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So now back to our question at the top of the programme. I asked what percentage of people will lie in a typical ten minute conversation. Was it:</p><p>a)    40%</p><p>b)    50%, or</p><p>c)    60%</p><p>What did you say Rob?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>I said a) just 40%.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well I'm afraid the answer was 60%.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Really? Goodness 60%! That's more than I expected.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Right, well before we go, let’s recap the vocabulary we talked about today. The first expression was '<strong>white lie'. </strong>A lie we tell without meaning to hurt someone, for example when I say to you – you look nice today!</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Wait, what did you say?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>But that is actually a <strong>distortion </strong>of the truth. A changing or bending of the truth.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Mmmm. This makes me think of the next expression, '<strong>malicious intent'</strong>. <strong>Intent </strong>is the reason or purpose for doing something, and doing something with a <strong><em>malicious</em> intent </strong>is doing it deliberately to be cruel or to hurt someone. I think you have <strong>a malicious intent</strong>, telling me that when you say I look nice, it’s just a lie!</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I’m just kidding!</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>That’s the <strong>norm</strong> for you, isn’t it, just kidding. A '<strong>norm' </strong>is the standard or ‘normal’ way that something is. In the clip we heard '<strong>societal norm' </strong>whichis the accepted or ‘normal’ way something is done in society.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>For example, telling children about Father Christmas.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Sssh! But yes you're right.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, sadly this isn’t a lie but that's all for this programme.

I'm Neil.</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>And I'm Rob.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Now Rob, you look like you enjoy a good meal.</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>Ha. Well, I do like eating out and I like to think I know a good meal when I have one.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Well that should give you an advantage with today’s quiz. In 2016, which is the last year we have statistics for, how many restaurants and mobile food services were there in the UK? Was it:<br/>a) about 75,000,<br/>b) about 83,000, or<br/>c) about 93,000?</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>Well, I know there are a lot, so I’m going to say 93,000 – but that is just a guess.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>I’ll reveal the answer a little later in the programme. Today we’re talking about being a foodie. Rob, what is a foodie?</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>Well I would describe a foodie as someone who has a strong interest in food. They like preparing it as well as eating it – they like using good ingredients and they’re probably not fans of fast food.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Angela Hartnett is one of Britain’s top chefs. In the BBC podcast The Bottom Line she talked about this topic. In this first clip how does she describe people who say they are foodies?</p><p><strong>Angela Hartnett</strong><br/>I think people who say they are foodies buy the books, watch TV and will cook a little bit.</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>She is saying that people who say they are foodies may not actually know that much about food. They buy books and watch cookery programmes on TV and will cook a little bit.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>A little bit is a common phrase that means ‘a small amount’ and if you do something a little bit it means you don’t do it a lot. You could just say ‘a little’, but adding ‘bit’ to the phrase makes it very natural.</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>Well, we heard a little bit of Angela Hartnett there. Let’s hear more now. What’s her description of a foodie?</p><p><strong>Angela Hartnett</strong><br/>My idea of a foodie is the very European idea that people go and shop every day, they understand one end of a pig from another. And maybe that's a bit romantic but I look at my mother, I look at my grandmother and our background, you know. They made food, they knew about what was expensive, they knew about quality and stuff like that.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Rob, do you know one end of a pig from another?</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>I hope so, but the point Angela Hartnett is making is that a true foodie has a good understanding, for example, of the different parts of an animal that are used in cooking and what they are used for. She says that idea might be a bit romantic.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>We normally think of the word romantic when we are talking about love and relationships, but that’s not what it means here, is it?</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>No. Romantic can also describe a pleasant ideal - an imaginary perfect way of life that forgets about the difficult things of everyday life.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Less hear some more from chef Angela Hartnett now. What is she worried about?</p><p><strong>Angela Hartnett</strong><br/>I think we think we're foodies but I think food is expensive in this country. I don't think it's affordable for lots of people and I think we are in danger of not knowing, you know, how to cook any more, how to make a meal for a family of four for five pounds.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>So Rob, what is Angela Hartnett worried about?</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>She commented that food was very expensive here in Britain. Many people don’t have enough money to buy it, as she said it’s not affordable. She thinks we might be in danger of not being able to feed out families cheaply.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Can you say a bit more about the phrase in danger of?</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>Sure, the phrase to be in danger of is followed by a gerund and it means that there is the possibility of something bad happening. It’s not happened yet, but it could happen.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Thanks Rob. Right, well we’re in danger of running out of time so let’s get to the answer to the question I asked at the start of the programme. I asked how many restaurants or mobile food services there were in the UK in 2016.</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>And I said – it was a guess – 93,000. But was I right?</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>I'm afraid you're 10,000 out! The answer is approximately 83,000.</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>Right, well I’ve still got a few more to get to before I can tick them all off my list!</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Me too! Well, before we go, let’s recap the words and phrases we talked about today. The first was foodie.</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>Yes, foodie is a modern word to describe someone who is very interested in all aspects of food, from buying, preparing and cooking to eating.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>And someone who may or may not know which end of a pig is which!</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>I think you’re being a little bit silly there, aren’t you?</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Well a little bit was our next phrase, wasn’t it?</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>Yes, a little bit: a very simple but a very natural conversational phrase that means a small amount.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>The next word was the adjective romantic. Not used in the context of love here though was it?</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>No, it wasn't. A romantic idea here is one that is not realistic but is an imagined perfect situation. For example, we have a very romantic view of our childhoods when every Christmas was a white Christmas and every summer holiday was baking hot and spent on the beach. Of course, it wasn’t like that at all. In reality both Christmas and summer were cold and rainy.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Then we had the adjective affordable, for something we have enough money to buy. Finally the phrase to be in danger of.</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>Yes, for the possibility of something bad happening.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Well, that's it for this programme.

Thanks for joining us and bye!</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>Bye-bye!</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Well I have to say, I’m a little bit hungry and if I don’t get some food soon I’m in danger of getting very grumpy.</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>You're always grumpy, Neil. But there is a very affordable café around the corner, let’s head over there now, shall we?</p><p> </p>",Transcript,<p><strong>foodie</strong><br/>someone who is very interested in all aspects of food</p><p><strong>a little bit</strong><br/>a small amount</p><p><strong>romantic<br/></strong>describes an imagined ideal situation</p><p><strong>affordable</strong><br/>something we have enough money to buy</p><p><strong>in danger of</strong><br/>the possibility of something bad happening</p>,Vocabulary

I'm Neil.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And I'm Rob.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Now Rob, Can you complete this saying: “Love and marriage go together like ….”</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Love and marriage go together like… a horse and carriage!</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>That’s right, and when was the last time you saw a horse and carriage?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well that would have been a while ago – they are quite rare now. Not an everyday sight.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Indeed. And according to recent statistics, marriage in the UK is getting rarer too. Not as rare as seeing a horse and carriage, but the numbers are falling. Before we look at this topic in a bit more detail, a little quiz for our listeners.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes, according to UK’s Office for National Statistics, how many opposite-sex marriages were there in 2015? Was it:</p><p>a)    239,000</p><p>b)    309,000</p><p>c)    339,000</p><p>Any idea Neil?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I have no idea but I'm going to have a guess and say a) 239,000.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>We’ll reveal the answer a little later in this programme. But whatever the correct number, the <strong>trend </strong>is downwards. Year on year there are fewer opposite sex couples getting married in the UK.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So why might this be? Are we falling out of love with marriage? Let’s hear from a couple of people with different views. First, here’s Tom from BBC Learning English - what doesn’t he like about the idea or <strong>concept </strong>of getting married?</p><p><strong>Tom Banks<br/></strong>I'm not that enthusiastic about the idea of marriage, to tell you the truth. I think it's a bit of <strong>an archaic concept</strong> these days and I'm a bit of <strong>a commitment phobe</strong> – I don't like the idea of signing a piece of paper that says I have to be with someone for the rest of my life and can never escape from that person I suppose – although I am in a very happy relationship at the moment.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>So that was Tom there. Not a fan of marriage. But what were his objections Neil?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, he described marriage as <strong>an archaic concept</strong>. When someone describes something as <strong>archaic </strong>they think it is very old fashioned, out of date – belonging to a different time.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>So that was one of his problems with marriage, but he also said that he was a <strong>commitment phobe</strong>. The suffix <strong>phobe</strong> means someone who is afraid of something. In some cases it can also be used as a standalone word, but it means the same. So a <strong>commitment phobe</strong> is someone who is afraid of, or doesn’t like the idea of <strong>commitment</strong>.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And when talking about relationships, <strong>commitment</strong> means being with one person and giving up the idea of being free to do whatever you want and see whoever you want romantically.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>So for <strong>commitment phobes</strong>, <strong>commitment</strong> means losing something.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>But that’s not true for everyone. Here’s Dan, also from BBC Learning English. What’s his view of marriage?</p><p><strong>Dan O'Brien<br/></strong>In general I think it's quite good. It has a very <strong>stabilising </strong>effect on society and it declares publicly to the world that you have found the right person for you and that you're in a committed relationship.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>So Dan is a fan. He thinks marriage has a <strong>stabilising</strong> effect on society. He sees marriage as being good for society as a whole - it makes society stronger, more stable.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And he also sees it as a way to say to everyone that you have a strong relationship, you are with the one person you love.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>So for Dan, <strong>commitment</strong> and being in a committed relationship is a good thing. Now, back to our question at the top of the programme. I asked: how many opposite-sex couples got married in the UK in 2015?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I took a guess, didn't I, and I said a) 239,000. Am I right?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>You are definitely right. The answer is 239,000 or 239,020 to be precise. That figure was 3.4% lower than 2014. So what do relationship experts think is the reason fewer people are getting married?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well there could be lots of reasons. In some countries the way society is changing means that there is less pressure to get married or stay married. As a result, there are more divorces. So perhaps children of divorced parents are less likely to get married themselves.</p><p>Right, well before we go, let’s recap the vocabulary we highlighted today. The first word was <strong>trend.</strong></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>A <strong>trend</strong> is the direction that something is changing over time. When it comes to marriage, the trend is for fewer marriages. And the trend for 6-Minute listeners is the opposite, going up, particularly when you are presenting, Neil</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Ah, that’s very nice of you, you’re very kind. The next two words were an <strong>archaic concept</strong>. <strong>Archaic </strong>is an adjective for something dated or old-fashioned.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>A bit like your fashion sense!</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Just when I was beginning to like you!</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Sorry about that, you know I don’t mean it. In the interview <strong>archaic</strong> was used to describe the <strong>concept</strong> of marriage, not your fashion sense. <strong>Concept </strong>is another word for an idea or belief. So an <strong>archaic concept</strong> is an old-fashioned idea.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Our next expression was <strong>commitment phobe</strong>. We use this phrase to talk about someone who is scared of the idea of a long-term relationship because they see it as giving up some freedoms. You’re obviously a <em>compliment</em> <strong>phobe</strong>! You’re afraid of saying nice things about someone so you always say something nasty as well!</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>I said I was sorry.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And finally we had the adjective <strong>stabilising</strong>. Something that is stable is strong and something that makes something strong can be described as <strong>stabilising</strong>. Dan expressed his belief that marriage had a <strong>stabilising</strong> effect on society.</p><p>Well, that's it for this programme.

Was it…</p><p>a) 5%<br/>b) 15%<br/>c) 25%</p><p>Listen to the programme to find out the answer.</p>",This week's question:,"6 Minute English discusses the trend for manbags. These designer accessories are being carried on the arms and shoulders of many modern men but they're not just for looking good, they're practical too. Find out who really is carrying one and learn some new vocabulary along the way", 29 Mar 2018,"<p><em>Note: This is not a word for word transcript</em></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Welcome to 6 Minute English, the programme where we explore an interesting topic and bring you some useful items of vocabulary. I'm Rob.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I'm Neil. And today we are discussing manbags.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes, manbags - they are the height of fashion at the moment – a stylish accessory that modern men are carrying. An <strong>accessory</strong> is an additional item added to something to make it more useful or attractive.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I'm not so sure Rob. I mean, I wouldn't be seen dead carrying a manbag!</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Really! So what do you carry your lose change, your credit cards, tickets and mobile phone in?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I just stuff everything in my pockets Rob – it's better than being a <strong>laughing stock</strong>, carrying a handbag around!</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>By laughing stock you mean everyone thinking of you as silly – but you wouldn't be because it's a manbag Neil – not a woman's handbag. Maybe I can convince you to change your mind by the end of the programme. But now let's not forget to ask you today's question…</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Is it about manbags by any chance?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>It is so it might be tricky for you to answer! According to market research company Mintel, how many men bought a manbag in the UK last year? Was it…</p><p>a) 5%<br/>b) 15%<br/>c) 25%</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well obviously not many, so I'm going to say 5%. And I'm not one of them!</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>OK, you've made that very clear! We'll find out the answer at the end of the programme anyway. Now let's talk more about manbags. For hundreds of years women have carried their possessions around in handbags, so why can't a man do the same with a manbag?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Maybe it's the name. Why can't it just be a bag? Why does a bag have to have a gender?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>It's a trend Neil – a stylish fashion item designed to look good on men. Many big names have flocked to adopt the trend. Pharrell Williams, David Beckham and Kanye West, are just some of those who've been spotted <strong>rocking</strong> a manbag. Rocking is an informal way of saying 'wearing'.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>But what's wrong with a <strong>sturdy</strong> briefcase – sturdy means strong and not easily damaged. Are you saying manbags are just fashionable?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>No, they're practical too. We've always needed bags to carry stuff around but what we carry these days has changed – you know laptops, mobiles, even our lunch – so why not have a trendy looking bag to carry these things around in?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I think part of the problem is carrying one is not seem as very a British by some people. We're not always as stylish as our some of our European neighbours, are we?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well, speak for yourself! But Nick Carvell, GQ Contributing Fashion Editor has a reason for this. Here he is speaking on BBC Radio 4's You and Yours programme…</p><p><strong>Nick Carvell, GQ Contributing Fashion Editor<br/></strong>In Britain we are still very tied up with that idea of <strong>masculinity</strong> that is almost so fragile that it can be dented by carrying a bag. We think a lot about that in this country in a way that I don't think a lot of European men do.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>So Nick feels some British men are still tied up with the idea of <strong>masculinity</strong> – these are the characteristics traditionally thought to be typical of men. And for us British men, these characteristics are fragile – they can be easily broken.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, we can also call it manliness – things like not crying during a sad film. It's a slightly old-fashion idea but it could still be dented – or affected – if a man was caught carrying a manbag.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Whereas some European men don't give it a lot of thought, according to Nick Carvell.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>But with people like Louis Vuitton, Fendi, Gucci and Dolce and Gabbana designing these bags, they're bound to have a <strong>hefty price tag</strong> – that's an informal way of saying a high price.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well fashion comes at a price Neil – you need to shake off your <strong>inhibitions</strong> – that's a feeling of embarrassment that stops you from doing something. And if you really want to be on trend you could also splash out on a 'murse' that's a man's purse, or a 'mote' – a man's tote bag? Have I convinced you?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>No, not really Rob. I have a feeling that a manbag by any other name is, well, a bag – and I have one - my trusty backpack.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well for some people, manbags are the thing – but, as I asked earlier, according to market research company Mintel, how many men actually bought a manbag in the UK last year? Was it…</p><p>a) 5%<br/>b) 15%<br/>c) 25%</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I said a) 5%. Come on, I must have been right!</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>You were wrong Neil. The answer was actually 15%. And nearly a quarter of 16-34 year olds have bought one.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well as I say Rob, a good practical backpack is for me. But now shall we unpack some of the vocabulary we've discussed today. Starting with '<strong>accessory' </strong>which is an additional item added to something to make it more useful or attractive. ""A tie is a smart accessory to wear with a suit.""</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Maybe, but you wouldn't catch me wearing a suit in my media job – it's all t-shirts and jeans for us! If I came to work in a suit I would be a <strong>'laughing stock</strong>' – I mean, I would be seen as someone who people think of as silly. </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Our next word was '<strong>sturdy</strong>' – something that is sturdy is strong and not easily damaged. ""If you're walking up a mountain you need to wear some sturdy walking boots.""</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Good advice – if I was going up a mountain, which I'm not. Next we mentioned '<strong>masculinity</strong>'. These are the characteristics that are traditionally thought to be typical of men. So we sometimes refer to it as being macho! Like: ""Neil went swimming in ice cold water to prove his masculinity.""  </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>That I would never do – I'd rather carry a manbag – despite their <strong>hefty price tag</strong> – that means 'high price'.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Finally, we also mentioned the word '<strong>inhibitions'</strong> – that's feelings of embarrassment that stop you from doing something. ""Neil's inhibitions are stopping him from carrying a manbag.""</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>It's a bag Rob – just a bag! But we've talked enough about this so that's it for this edition of 6 Minute English. But before you rush off to purchase a designer manbag, don't forget to visit our Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube pages.

I'm Neil by the way and today we're off on an adventure.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>But not a very big adventure Neil – it's just a mini or microadventure – but if you have <strong>wanderlust</strong> – a strong desire to travel – I think it may appeal.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>It will appeal to you Rob because you love to travel – haven't you circumnavigated the globe – I mean go all the way round the world? </p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Almost Neil – but today's mini-adventure doesn't involve travelling too far from home. We'll explore the topic more in a moment but not before we've set today's quiz question. So Neil do you know how far it is around the world measured at the equator – in other worlds the circumference? It is approximately…</p><p>a) 30,000 km<br/>b) 40,000 km, or<br/>c) 50,000 km</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, I haven't walked it but I know it's a long way – so I'll go for c) 50,000 km.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>I shall keep you in suspense and tell you the answer at the end of the programme. Our topic for discussion won't be travelling so far – it's about a new trend for small adventures.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>What you mean are shorter breaks, closer to home. They're less expensive of course but also instil <strong>a sense of adventure</strong> – that's the feeling of doing a new, exciting and sometimes dangerous activity.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well, adventurer, Alastair Humphreys has coined the phrase 'microadventures' to describe this. '<strong>To coin</strong>' here means to use a word or phrase that no one has used before.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Now he's someone who goes on big trips and expeditions to the four corners of the globe and writing books about his adventures. But he wanted to prove you don't have to go far to find adventure.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Let's hear from him now – speaking on BBC Radio 4's You and Yours programme – about what he did. How did he describe his first microadventure?</p><p><strong>Alastair Humphreys, adventurer<br/></strong>I'd been doing big adventures for years and I had this hunch that you didn't need to go to the ends of the world to have some sort of adventure. You didn't need to be in beautiful Patagonia to have the spirit of adventure. So I decided to try and prove my theory by doing the most boring, ugly adventure I could think of. And I came up with the idea of walking a lap of the M25 in the snow in January. And time and again as I walked round the M25 I just kept thinking to myself this experience is exactly the same as the four years I spent cycling round the world. Smaller, of course, a bit silly, but definitely felt like an adventure And that's when I really started to come up with the idea of microadventures.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So a microadventure is a boring, ugly adventure?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>No Neil. It may not be glamourous but it is an adventure. He walked around the London orbital motorway – called the M25 – to prove his <strong>hunch</strong> that you don't need to go far to find adventure. A hunch is an idea you have based on feelings but there's no proof.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well his hunch was right. But walking alongside a motorway isn't my idea of adventure.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>It doesn't have to be Neil. Just getting out on your bike and exploring somewhere in your locality that you haven't visited before is an adventure. And how about camping?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Ah yes, I do like to camp out – that's a phrasal verb to mean sleep outside in a tent. You can be so close to nature and breathe in the fresh air.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yep and you don't need to go far for a camping adventure – and being out a night really adds to the sense of adventure. That's what Alastair Humphreys believes…</p><p><strong>Alastair Humphreys, adventurer<br/></strong>We humans are so boring these days – we so rarely spend time out in the darkness to see the stars and to see how the world feels different by night. I get a little bit nervous still – I still imagine ghosts – but that's part of the charm of making a little frisson of adventure. And then in the morning the sun comes up, the birds sing, jump in a river, back on the bus, back to your desk for 9.00.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Seeing how the world feels at night is a nice idea. Getting a bit nervous – anxious maybe – is part of the pleasure or enjoyment – what Alastair calls '<strong>charm</strong>'.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I agree – and he used another word 'frisson' meaning a sudden, strong feeling of excitement, or fear.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>My biggest fear would be returning to my desk for 9.00! But Alastair is right, there is an adventure to be had <strong>on your doorstep</strong> – that means close to where you live.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>But only a small adventure Rob! Unlike an adventure round the circumference of the Earth.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes that was my question earlier: how far it is around the world measured at the equator – in other worlds the circumference? It is approximately…</p><p>a)    30,000 km<br/>b)    40,000 km, or<br/>c)    50,000 km</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I said c) 50,000 km.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Sorry Neil – too far. The Earth's circumference has been calculated to be 40,075km. To travel that distance would be a major adventure.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>OK, I think we should remind ourselves of the some of the words and phrases we've discussed today – starting with <strong>wanderlust </strong>– a strong desire to travel. ""Rob has wanderlust, he's never at home!""</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>That's because I have <strong>a sense of adventure</strong>. That's the feeling of doing a new, exciting and sometimes dangerous activity. ""Neil has no sense of adventure because he likes his holidays to be planned out with no surprises!""</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>That's a little unfair Rob – I just like to be 'holiday happy' – that's a term I've just <strong>coined</strong>, which means used a word or phrase that no one has used before. You can also say 'to coin a phrase' after using an expression that is well known and possibly used too much.</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/> Next we heard <strong>hunch</strong> – that's an idea you have based on feelings but there's no proof. ""I have a hunch Neil wants to go to the pub – he's packing his bag!""</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Your hunch is correct Rob. But not before we recap our next word <strong>charm</strong> – that's part of the pleasure or enjoyment of something. ""Part of the charm of going to the seaside is eating ice cream and walking down the pier.""</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And finally we heard<strong> on your doorstep - </strong>that means close to where you live. ""There's a pub right on your doorstep, so why don't you make the most of it!""</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/> I intend to Rob but first let me to remind you that you can learn English with us at bbclearningenglish.com. That's it for today's 6 Minute English. We hope you enjoyed it. Bye for now.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Bye.</p>",Transcript,"Join us for six minutes of adventure!

But that's easier said than done as acquiring this new skill can be hard. 6 Minute English looks at the reasons for learning a new language and hears from an expert who has a tip for making it easier., 15 Mar 2018,"<p><em>Note: This is not a word for word transcript</em></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English– the show that brings you an interesting topic, authentic listening practice and vocabulary to help you improve your language skills. I'm Rob…</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Watashi no namae wa Neil desu. And that means 'my name's Neil'. </p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>So Neil, here's a question for you – can you speak any languages other than English of course? I think you can!</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Un poco de español  that means a little bit of Spanish. Some Japanese, which I tried at the beginning and also a bit of Czech language - Dobrý den, jak se máš?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Very impressive. So what tips can you give for learning to speak another language?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, practise, practise, practise – and don't be afraid of making mistakes as I no doubt have.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Of course. Well my aim this year is to <strong>master</strong> the Spanish language. Master means to learn thoroughly.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Muy bien! Well you're not alone. A survey by the British Council found learning a language is a new year's resolution for about one in five Britons in 2018. So learning Spanish is a good start Rob but do you know approximately how many languages there are in the world altogether? Are there…</p><p>a)    70<br/>b)    700<br/>c)    7,000</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well I know there are many but surely not 7,000 so I'm going to say b) 700 – but don't expect me to learn all of them.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I won't Rob. But I will give you the answer later. So, we all know learning another language is a good thing – it brings us many benefits.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes, we can communicate with people from other countries and when we're travelling we can understand what signs and notices say. So we don't get lost.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>That's right – but many scientists also believe that knowledge of another language can boost your brainpower. A study of monolingual and bilingual speakers suggests speaking two languages can help slow down the brain's decline with age.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>All good reasons. But Neil, learning another language is hard. It would take me years and years to become fluent in say, Mandarin – by <strong>fluent</strong> I mean speak very well, without difficulty.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well this depends on your mother tongue. In general, the closer the second language is to the learner's native tongue and culture in terms of vocabulary, sounds or sentence structure - the easier it will be to learn.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>But whatever the language, there is so much vocabulary to learn – you know, thousands and thousands of words.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Maybe not Rob. Professor Stuart Webb, a linguist from the University of Western Ontario, may be able to help you. He spoke to BBC Radio 4's More or Less programme and explained that you don't need to do that…</p><p><strong>Professor Stuart Webb, linguist, University of Western Ontario<br/></strong>For language learners in a foreign language setting – so for example if you were learning French in Britain or English in Japan, students may often really struggle to learn more than 2,000, 3,000 words after many years of study. So for example, there was study in Taiwan recently that showed that after nine years of study about half of the students had still failed to learn the most frequent 1,000 words. Now they knew lower <strong>frequency</strong> words but they hadn't mastered those most important words.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So Rob, don't waste your time trying to learn every single word. Professor Webb spoke there about research that showed students knew lower <strong>frequency</strong> words but weren't learning enough high frequency words.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Right, and frequency here means the number of times something happens – so the important words to learn are the high frequency ones – and how many are there exactly?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Here's Professor Stuart Webb again…</p><p><strong>Professor Stuart Webb, linguist, University of Western Ontario<br/></strong>For example, with English, I would suggest if you learn the 800 most frequent <strong>lemmas</strong> – which is a word and its <strong>inflections</strong> – that will account for about 75 per cent of all of the English language. So that learning those 800 words first will provide the <strong>foundation</strong> for which you may be able to learn the lower frequency words.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Fascinating stuff. And good to know I just need to learn about 800 words – or what he calls lemmas.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes a lemma is the simplest form or base form of a word. And the <strong>inflection</strong> here refers to how the base word is changed according to its use in a sentence. Knowing these things give you a foundation – the basics from which you language learning will develop. Simple</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Thank goodness I am learning just one new language!</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>But how many languages could you potentially be learning Rob? Earlier I asked you, approximately how many languages there are in the world altogether? Are there…</p><p>a)    70<br/>b)    700<br/>c)    7,000</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And I said 700. Was I right?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>No Rob, you were wrong. There are around 7,000 recognised languages in the world but UNESCO has identified 2,500 languages which it claims are at risk of extinction.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>A sobering thought Neil. Now shall we remind ourselves of some of the English vocabulary we've heard today. Starting with <strong>master</strong>.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>To master a new skill, in this context, means to learn thoroughly or learn well. ""Rob hopes to master Spanish before he starts a new job in Madrid.""</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>That's news to me Neil! But it would be good to be <strong>fluent</strong> in Spanish – or any language – or to speak it fluently – that's speaking it well and without difficulty.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Now our next word was <strong>frequency</strong>.  Here we are referring to high and low frequency words – so it means how often they occur. Examples of a high frequency word are 'it', 'the' and 'and'.</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/> And our next word is <strong>inflections</strong>. These are the changes to the basic form of words according to their function in a sentence. Such as adding an 's' to the end of a word to make it plural.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And don't forget <strong>lemma</strong> which is the simplest form or base form of a word before an inflection is added.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And finally <strong>foundation</strong> which means the basics your learning grows from.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/> That just leaves me to remind you that you can learn English with us at bbclearningenglish.com. That's it for today's 6 Minute English. We hope you enjoyed it. Bye for now. Na shledanou. Hasta luego.

But do they work? And what are the risks? Join Rob and Catherine as they discuss robot therapy., 08 Mar 2018,"<p><em>Note: This is not a word for word transcript</em></p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Welcome to 6 Minute English, the programme where we explore an interesting topic and bring you six items of useful vocabulary. I'm Catherine.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And I'm Rob.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>I have a question for you, Rob: how would you feel about having <strong>therapy</strong> from a robot?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>I'm not too sure about that – you'll need to tell me more! But first things first, the word <strong>therapy</strong> refers to a kind of treatment that helps someone feel better – including treatment for mental health issues. Someone who delivers <strong>therapy</strong> is called a therapist.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>We'll find out more about this robot therapist in just a moment, but first, Rob, I've got a question for you about the scale of mental health issues globally. So roughly how many people do you think experience mental health issues at some point during their lifetime? Is it…</p><p>a) One in ten people<br/>b) One in four, or<br/>c) One in three</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>I'll go for one in four, but I know whichever answer is right – it's a big issue. How might a robot therapist help?</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>We're not talking about a robot in the Star Wars sense – so there's no flashing lights and mechanical arms, Rob! It's actually an app in your smartphone that talks to you – and it's called Woebot.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>So – it has a sense of humour. <strong>Woe</strong> means 'sadness'; so this is a '<strong>woe</strong>' bot, not a robot.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And it was developed by psychologist Dr Alison Darcy from Stanford University in the US. Here she is, talking to the BBC radio programme All in the Mind.</p><p><strong>Dr Alison Darcy, Stanford University<br/></strong>Well, after you start an initial conversation with the Woebot, and he'll take you through sort of what he can do and what he can't do, he'll just essentially <strong>check in with </strong>you every day and just give you a sort of figurative tap on the shoulder and say: ""Hey Claudia, how are you doing? What's going on in your day? How do you feel?"" So if you say, like ""I'm really, really stressed out"", Woebot might offer to help talk you through something.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Woebot <strong>checks in with </strong>you every day and asks you how you are.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>So here, to <strong>check in with</strong> someone doesn't mean to register at a hotel with that person! It's an informal way of saying you talk to someone in order to report or find out information.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And this usage is more common in the United States. So for example: ""I can't meet you today, Rob, but I'll <strong>check in with</strong> you tomorrow to see how the project is getting on.""</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>So, this robot <strong>checks in with</strong> you every day. It tracks your mood and talks to you about your emotions, using a technique called cognitive behavioural <strong>therapy</strong>.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Cognitive behavioural <strong>therapy</strong> is a common therapeutic technique that helps people deal with problems by changing the way they think.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>That all sounds great, but does Woebot actually work?</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>They've done some trials which show it can be more effective than simply reading information about mental health. But they haven't compared Woebot to a real therapist due to <strong>ethical</strong> concerns.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes, it could be <strong>unethical</strong> to deny a real patient access to a human therapist for the sake of a trial. <strong>Ethical </strong>basically means 'morally right'.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And another concern is privacy. People who use apps like this are not protected by strong privacy laws.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Despite these fears, digital therapy is booming – and Woebot is just one of an increasing number of electronic services. One reason for this could be using an app carries less <strong>stigma</strong> than maybe seeing a human therapist.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And<strong> stigma</strong> refers to the negative associations that people have about something, especially when these associations are not fair. Even though mental health is now being talked about more openly than before, some people do still see mental health issues and <strong>therapy</strong> negatively.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Whatever you think of robot therapy, Dr Darcy believes that in the modern world people need to <strong>self-reflect</strong> more – which means thinking deeply about yourself, in order to understand the reasons behind your feelings.</p><p><strong>Dr Alison Darcy, Stanford University<br/></strong>The world that we live in right now is very noisy. Particularly digitally. You know, since we've had these little computers in our pockets with us everywhere we go, there aren't that many opportunities for real silence or <strong>self-reflection</strong>. You know, even a commute on the tube might have been a moment to just take a second to yourself, but now that void can be filled always with super-engaging content by looking at your phone.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Darcy believes that we don't have much time for <strong>self-reflection</strong> because there are so many distractions in life – especially smartphones!</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>After discussing all this – would you actually try a therapy app like this?</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Yes I would, actually – I think it might be quite helpful.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And how about the question you asked me at the beginning of the programme: how many people experience mental health issues?</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>The answer was: one in four, according the World Health Organisation and the World Federation for Mental Health. But the WHO say that as many as two-thirds of people never seek help from a health professional – with <strong>stigma </strong>being one of the main reasons.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And just there we had <strong>stigma </strong>again; let's now run through the other words we learned today.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>So we had <strong>woe</strong> - meaning 'sadness'. I'm full of <strong>woe</strong>. <strong>Woe</strong> is me!</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Maybe you need some <strong>therapy</strong> – that's the process of receiving treatment for a particular health issue, especially mental health illness.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And we had – to<strong> check in with</strong> someone. After we finish this programme, I need to <strong>check in with </strong>the boss about my new project.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>We also had <strong>self-reflection </strong>– that's the process of thinking deeply about yourself.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And finally we had <strong>ethical</strong>. If you describe something as <strong>ethical</strong>, you mean it's morally right.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>So<strong> woe</strong>, <strong>stigma</strong>, <strong>therapy</strong>, <strong>check in with</strong>, <strong>self-reflection</strong> and <strong>ethical</strong>. That's it for this edition of 6 Minute English. We'll leave you to <strong>self-reflect</strong> – and after you've done that, do visit our Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube pages, and of course our website!</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Bye for now.</p><p><strong>Both<br/></strong>Bye bye!</p>",Transcript,"<p><strong>therapy</strong> <br/> treatment (often for mental illness)</p><p><strong>woe<br/></strong>sadness</p><p><strong>check in with (someone)<br/></strong>(informal) meet or talk to someone to exchange information</p><p><strong>ethical<br/></strong>morally right</p><p><strong>stigma<br/></strong>negative perception held by people, especially an unfair perception</p><p><strong>self-reflection<br/></strong>thinking about yourself in order to understand yourself</p>",Vocabulary

And just why are greetings so important? Join Rob and Catherine in 6 Minute English as they explore the world of greetings, and say 'hello' to some useful vocabulary!", 01 Mar 2018,"<p><em>Note: This is not a word for word transcript</em></p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Hello. I'm Catherine.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Hello. I'm Rob.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>We both started with what is probably the best-known greeting in English and one of the first words English language students learn, and that is 'hello'! So today in 6 Minute English we're digging a little deeper into the world of greetings and the fascinating history of 'hello'.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Surprisingly, the word 'hello' is not as old as you might think. But when did it first appear in print in English?</p><p>Was it:</p><p>a)    in the 1890s<br/>b)    the 1950s or<br/>c)    the1820s</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Well, I think English changes really quickly, so I'm going to say b) the 1950s. And we'll say 'hello again' to 'hello' a little later in the programme.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>First, greetings. They can be a bit of a <strong>minefield</strong>. A subject full of unpredictable difficulties.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>While in many places a handshake or bow is normal – there's also the tricky question of kisses and hugs.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Awkward. Should you kiss? How many times? And should your lips touch their cheek?</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>No, Rob - definitely an <strong>air-kiss</strong>! Close to the cheek, but don't touch. Much safer.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Greetings are the subject of a new book, by former British diplomat Andy Scott, called One Kiss or Two: In Search of the Perfect Greeting. Here he is on a BBC radio show Word of Mouth. Why are greetings so important?</p><p><strong>Andy Scott, author<br/></strong>These are the first moments of interaction we have with people. And it's in those first moments, and using those verbal and physical <strong>rituals</strong> that we have and we can <strong>get in such a</strong> <strong>muddle</strong> about, that we're kind of recognising each other and reaffirming our <strong>bonds</strong> or even testing our bonds and our relationships with each other, we're signalling our intentions towards each other, despite the fact we might not necessarily be conscious when we're doing them.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Scott says we need to communicate our intentions to each other and acknowledge our relationships.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well, that's what greetings do. One word he uses to mean 'relationship' or 'connection' is <strong>bond</strong>. We can reaffirm our <strong>bonds</strong>, which means we confirm them and make them stronger.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And we do it through <strong>rituals </strong>-patterns of behaviour that we do for a particular purpose. So there are the phrases such as 'hello', 'good afternoon', 'nice to meet you', and as well as the physical rituals – handshakes, bows and kisses.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Though he also said we sometimes want to test our <strong>bonds</strong>. We might want to check if our friendship has grown by offering something warmer than usual – like a hug instead of a handshake.</p><p>Now, Scott acknowledges how difficult greetings can be – using the very British slang phrase – <strong>to get in a muddle</strong>. If you <strong>get in a muddle</strong>, you become confused or lost. You might <strong>get in a muddle </strong>if one person expects two kisses and the other expects only one.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Though Scott does believe that the details don't really matter, because another important purpose of greetings is to reduce tension. So if you get it wrong, just laugh about it.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>OK, let's get back to the one word we really shouldn't <strong>get in a muddle</strong> about, 'hello'.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Let's listen to Dr Laura Wright, a linguist from Cambridge University, also speaking on the BBC Word of Mouth radio programme. Where does 'hello' come from?</p><p><strong>Dr Laura Wright, Linguist and BBC presenter<br/></strong>It starts as a distant <strong>hailing</strong>: ""I see you miles over there and I've got to yell at you."" It's not until the invention of telephones we really get to use hello as a greeting to each other, and even then it wasn't initially used as a greeting, it was used more as an attention-grabbing device: ""You are miles away, the line is about to be cut, I need to attract the attention of the operator as well."" And so everybody would call 'hello' to each other as this long-distance greeting form.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Laura says 'hello' hasn't always meant 'hello' – originally it was just a shout to attract someone's attention. And we call this kind of shouting <strong>hailing</strong>.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>The shout would vary in form – it could sound like a 'hollo'! Or a 'hulloa'!</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>We continued this kind of <strong>hailing</strong> when telephones first appeared. People would keep repeating 'hello, hello' while they were waiting to be connected. And before long, this became the actual way to greet somebody on the telephone. Anyway, before we say 'goodbye' to 'hello' – let's have the answer to today's question.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>I asked when the word first appeared in print in English. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, it was in 1826. Other spellings appeared before that.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Ah, you see – I was thinking English changes really quickly, but not that quickly.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Not that quickly.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>So before we go, let's have a look at today's vocabulary again. A <strong>minefield</strong> is something that is full of uncertainty and even danger. This sense comes from the literal meaning – a field full of explosive landmines!</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And then we had <strong>air-kiss</strong> – which is when you kiss the air beside someone's face, instead of the face itself! Like this: mwah.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And we had <strong>bond</strong> – a connection. There's a close <strong>bond</strong> between us I think, Rob.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Which is good, because when I <strong>get in a muddle</strong>, you're always very understanding!</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Yeah.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>To <strong>get in a muddle</strong> means to become confused.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong><strong>Ritual</strong> was another word – <strong>rituals</strong> are certain behaviours that people perform in certain contexts. I have a morning <strong>ritual</strong>, for example: brush my teeth, eat breakfast… I didn't say it was an interesting ritual, Rob!</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>No, that's true. Finally, <strong>to hail</strong> – it's to greet someone loudly, especially from a distance. I <strong>hailed</strong>   my friend when I saw her at the airport.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And that's it for this programme.

Hmm, I'm not a good dancer either.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>How about the new craze of 'mermaiding' which is making a splash at the moment – in other words becoming very popular. The idea originated in America but is now popular in the UK and Europe.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>OK. Tell me more!</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Let's hear from an expert – Emma Longden, who's founder of Fin2Fit – which runs classes, teaching the skills of swimming safely like a mermaid…</p><p><strong>Emma Longden, founder, Fin2Fit<br/></strong>Mermaiding is putting a monofin on your feet. Putting a beautiful tail on and getting in the water and swimming like a mermaid.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>OK, so I would need to wear a monofin – the prefix '<strong>mono</strong>' means 'only one or single' – so a single fin –that's  like a mermaid's tail - then I just get in the water and swim like a mermaid – I'm not so sure about that Neil – I don't really know how mermaids swim!</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>There's more to it than that Rob. It's actually good for your fitness as Emma can explain…</p><p><strong>Emma Longden, founder, Fin2Fit<br/></strong>It gives children's confidence in water a boost, it improves their water strength, it gives you an entire body workout. It works your cardiovascular system, it works your legs, your core – it improves the children's swimming technique, flexibility, balance, co-ordination – you get the reward, you get the social aspect – and alongside all of that, they're learning vital life skills along the way.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So there are many benefits to mermaiding Rob. Improving confidence, strength, technique and it's good for your cardiovascular system – <strong>cardiovascular</strong> relates to your heart and blood vessels.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>I like the sound of the <strong>social</strong> aspect – and by that Emma means being with other people and having fun. It's an activity that's sociable.  And it teaches life skills – useful skills that help you deal with everyday challenges. Well that's great for kids – and that's the problem.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>What's that?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Mermaiding is for kids – so I can't get involved – even if I wanted to… can I?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>You can Rob. According to Emma, it's growing in popularity with adults too – any excuse to live out your fantasies hey!</p><p><strong>Emma Longden, founder, Fin2Fit<br/></strong>There are so many adults that actually kind of want to live out their childhood dreams that they wanted to be a mermaid when they were children and they didn't get the opportunity and now it's here and now it's available and... So yes, we do a lot of adult classes as well.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>There you go Rob – living out your childhood dreams – that doing things you wanted to do when you were a child. Like being a mermaid!</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Sorry Neil, that wasn't a dream for me – although I did dream of swimming like a shark once! Anyway, mermaiding is a good form of aerobic exercise – but earlier I asked you what an example of anaerobic exercise is. Is it…</p><p>a)    weightlifting</p><p>b)    kickboxing</p><p>c)    dancing</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I said weightlifting. Was I right?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>You were Neil, well done. Any exercise that consists of short exertion, high-intensity movement is an anaerobic exercise – such as weight lifting, sprinting and jumping. I won't go into scientific detail – but aerobics exercise is done over a longer period of time and strengthens the heart and lungs, thereby improving the body's utilisation of oxygen.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Thanks for that Rob. Now I think we should sprint through our recap of some of the words we've talked about today – starting with '<strong>aerobic'</strong>, which you just explained. ""Mermaiding is a good aerobic workout.""</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Assuming you don't mind dressing up! Next we had '<strong>aquatic'</strong> which refers to something connected with water. ""Synchronised swimming is an example of an aquatic sport.""</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Ah, you slipped in another of our words there – '<strong>synchronised'</strong> – which means 'moving together at the same time or speed as someone or something else'. ""We synchronised our watches so that we all arrived at the same time.""</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Good idea – you're always late Neil. Then we mentioned '<strong>mono'</strong> which means 'one' or 'single' and is used as a prefix on words such as 'monochrome' – one colour – or 'monorail' – a train running on a single track.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Then we heard the word '<strong>cardiovascular' - </strong> a word that relates to the effect on your heart and lungs. ""Experts say those who quit smoking could also quickly reduce their risk of cardiovascular disease.""</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Finally, we also mentioned '<strong>social'</strong> – this adjective relates to activities that you do with other people and are usually fun. ""Now I live in London, I have a great social life.""</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well you never invite me out Rob!  Anyway, that's it for this edition of 6 Minute English.

Join our discussion about them and learn some new vocabulary in 6 Minute English.", 15 Feb 2018,"<p><em>Note: This is not a word for word transcript</em></p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>Hello I'm Rob and this is 6 Minute English – a programme that brings you an interesting topic, authentic listening practice and some vocabulary to help you improve your language skills. Joining me today is Neil.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Hello. And today we're discussing those pilotless aircraft that we seem to be hearing and reading a lot about at the moment.</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>You mean drones. And yes, they are in the news quite often for good and bad reasons. They've been used for many things from smuggling drugs, detecting water leaks and <strong>surveillance</strong>.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>And surveillance – that means ‘the act of carefully watching someone or something’ – perhaps a criminal – but also it means spying, maybe on me and you Rob? So should we be welcoming the rise of the use of drones?</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>Well, before our discussion about that 'takes off', we need to set today's question for you to answer, Neil.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>What are you <strong>droning on</strong> about Rob? And by that I don't mean ‘flying a drone’ – I mean ‘talking too much in a very boring way’!</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>Thanks Neil. Now just answer this, will you? Drones are sometimes also referred to as UAVs. So, what does UAV stand for? Is it…</p><p>a) Unidentified aerial vehicle<br/>b) Unmanned aerial vehicle<br/>c) Unaided aircraft vehicle</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Well, I'm going to go for b) unmanned aerial vehicle.</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>Ok well, we'll see if you're right later on. Now let's talk more about drones, which, apparently, seem to be everywhere now.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>But are they safe and are they necessary? I've heard about them being a hazard to aircraft because they've been flown close to airports.</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>Well, figures in 2016 showed that in the UK there were 70 near misses involving drones. And that's more than double the year before. So that is a little worrying.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Yes. And there's the potential risk of people's privacy being invaded when a drone is flown over their property with a camera attached to it.</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>Ah, but those cameras are also good at capturing some great <strong>aerial footage</strong> – that's the film recording of the view from the above the ground. So they're not all bad. And Dr Yoge Patel would agree. She is CEO of Blue Bear, which supplies unmanned planes and drones. Here she is speaking about drones on the BBC's Woman's Hour programme…</p><p><strong>Dr Yoge Patel, CEO of Blue Bear</strong><br/>They have the potential to be dangerous, agreed. They also have though, on the flip side, the ability to be a <strong>game changer</strong> in both domestic use and in military use. So, some of our drones are being used for aircraft inspections. We've put our drones into Fukushima.</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>So there you go Neil. There are many useful things drones can do, and Dr Patel said they have the ability to be a game changer.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>And by that you mean ‘something that completely changes the way something is done or thought about’.</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>Yes. Her company has used drones to inspect the inside of the damaged Fukushima nuclear power station in Japan. And another example of drones being a game changer is UNICEF and the Malawian government testing drones for carrying medical supplies. This could help save lives in remote places.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>And I have read that in Australia, lifeguards are using drones to help rescue swimmers who get in trouble in the sea.</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>And have you heard about a Japanese firm that's planning to use a drone to force employees out of their offices by playing music at them if they stay to work evening overtime.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>I haven't, but you've convinced me – it seems like <strong>the sky's the limit</strong> for the uses of drones! I mean there's no limit to what they can do. But I am a little concerned about how they are regulated or controlled.</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>Well Dr Yoge Patel says because the technology is new, regulations – or legal controls - are developing all the time…</p><p><strong>Dr Yoge Patel, CEO, Blue Bear</strong><br/>As technology progresses, regulation and operational use needs to then be <strong>harmonised</strong> with it. And we are, as a community, going through that whole process of saying what is proportionate and appropriate regulation to go with different uses of drones.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>So she talked about regulations being harmonised as technology progresses.</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>So I think she means ‘making regulations suitable and appropriate for what the drones are being used for’. So they need some control, but not so they can't be useful and effective.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Like flying drones to stop you working late! Now Rob, I'm dying to know what the other name for a drone is.</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>OK, let me tell you. So earlier I asked what does UAV stand for? Was it…</p><p>a) Unidentified aerial vehicle<br/>b) Unmanned aerial vehicle<br/>c) Unaided aircraft vehicle</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>And I said b) – was that correct?</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>Yes Neil, you know your drones – that's correct. Well done. UAVs or drones have been around for quite a while in different forms. It's thought they were first used for providing practice targets for training military personnel. OK Neil, let's quickly go over some of the vocabulary we have mentioned today, starting with surveillance.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>""The police kept the jewellery shop under surveillance because they had a tip-off about a robbery."" So that means ‘carefully watching someone or something, usually to try to stop something illegal’.</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>Then we mentioned aerial footage – that's film recording made from the sky. ""The aerial footage on TV of the dolphins swimming was spectacular.""</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Yes, drones have been a game changer for wildlife programmes on TV. That means ‘something that completely changes the way something is done or thought about’.</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>We also mentioned the phrase 'the sky's the limit', meaning ‘there's no limit to something’. ""The sky is the limit to what professional footballers can earn these days.""</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Then we discussed harmonised – that describes two things being suitable for each other to allow them to work properly. ""The garden has been designed to harmonise with the natural landscape.""</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>Very useful vocabulary, Neil. But let's stop droning on – and that means ‘talking too much in a boring way’ - and remind everyone to check out our You Tube, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram pages – and of course, our website at bbclearningenglish.com. See you next time.

One new idea – called Hyperloop One - is to travel at high speed in a pod through a metal tube. But will it catch on?", 08 Feb 2018,"<p><em>Note: This is not a word for word transcript</em></p><p><strong>Rob</strong></p><p>Hello I'm Rob and this is 6 Minute English– the show that brings you an interesting topic, authentic listening practice and some vocabulary to help you improve your language skills</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And hello, I'm Neil. Our topic today is transport. How do you think you'll be travelling to work in, say 30 years' time?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well, not only will homeworking be more prevalent – that means ‘common’ – but I hope I won't be working in 30 years' time!</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Good answer! But if we look back and see how transport has changed in the last 30 years, it makes you wonder what the future holds.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes, we've seen how air travel has become <strong>commonplace</strong> for many people. Commonplace means ‘not unusual’. And there's been the development of high-speed train travel. But the main priority has been speed – going faster to make your journeys quicker.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>That's true, and we'll be discussing some ideas for making transport even faster soon. But let's not waste any time and speed on to today's quiz question.<br/> <br/> <strong>Rob</strong><br/> Ah yes, time waits for no one, not even you Neil. So can you answer this question? According to Guinness World Records, in which country has the fastest ever train been recorded? Is it in…</p><p>a) China</p><p>b) Japan</p><p>c) France<br/> </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>All these countries have fast trains but I've heard that Chinese trains go particularly fast. I'm going to say a) China.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well, you'll have to wait until the end of the programme to see if you're right. But let's talk more now about the future of transport. One development we hear much about is <strong>automation</strong>.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Automation means ‘using machines to do work that humans normally do’ and in terms of transport this means driverless vehicles. It won't be too long before we become the passenger in a driverless car.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Scary! And the French train engineering company, Alstom, is planning to test automated freight trains later this year. The automated train <strong>prototype </strong>can travel for about 100 kilometres without driver intervention. A prototype is the first version of something which can be tested before it is produced in large quantities.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Of course some trains are already driven by computers but there's an exciting plan to develop a form of driverless vehicle that could move you around at 1,123 kilometres per hour.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Come on Neil. That sounds a bit <strong>far-fetched</strong> – like flying cars that we see in sci-fi movies – it's difficult to believe because it's unlikely to happen.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well you say that but it's already being tested in Nevada in the USA and has a name – Hyperloop One.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Tell me more!</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>The idea is, you get loaded into a pod then you're pushed through a metal tube at high speed, taking you to your destination in minutes rather than hours. Anita Sengupta is the lead systems engineer and says there's nothing scary about it…</p><p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Anita Sengupta, Lead systems engineer, Virgin Hyperloop One<br/></strong>The Hyperloop is a maglev train in a vacuum system – or in a vacuum tube – and so you can also think of it as an aircraft flying at 200,000 feet so people don't have any issue flying in aeroplanes and people don't have any issue going in maglev trains. This is simply combining the two and allows you to be more energy efficient.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>So Anita Sengupta explained the type of technology the Hyperloop used. First she mentioned <strong>maglev</strong> – that's a short way of saying magnetic levitation. </p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/> It's when trains travel on magnetic track rather than conventional rails.<strong><br/> <br/> Rob</strong><br/> And then she mentioned a <strong>vacuum</strong> system - a vacuum is a space that has had all the air and any other gases removed from it. So the tube these pods travel in have no air in so there's no resistance. And these technologies are more efficient and they save energy.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Which is a good thing. This sounds like a great way to travel but will it take off?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well, BBC technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones isn't so sure. He thinks it will be quite challenging to convince governments to allow long metal tubes to be built on or below ground.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>But we have to try these new technologies Rob. If we didn't we'd still be travelling around on horse and cart!</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>A good point Neil – and we wouldn't have been able to travel at the great speeds mentioned in today's question. Now earlier I asked you according to Guinness World Records, in which country has the fastest ever train travelled? Is it in…</p><p>a) China</p><p>b) Japan</p><p>c) France</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I said a) China.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And you were wrong Neil. China does have some very fast trains. But the fastest recorded train was a maglev from the Central Japan Railway Company, which ran on a test track at a speed of 603 kilometres per hour.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Now that would make my commute to work very quick! OK, shall we recap some of the vocabulary we've heard today? Starting with <strong>commonplace</strong>.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Which means ‘not unusual or often seen’. For example 'free Wi-Fi in coffee shops is commonplace these days.'</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And very useful it is too! Next we had <strong>automation</strong>, meaning ‘using a machine to do something instead of a human.’ 'Automation in the car making industry has led to the loss of hundreds of jobs.'</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Of course when you build a new car you need to make a <strong>prototype</strong> – that's the first version of something which can be tested before it is produced in large quantities. 'The prototype of a new solar-powered bike has been so successful that it's now going into mass-production.'</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Come on Rob, that sounds a bit <strong>far-fetched</strong> – and by that I mean ‘so unbelievable it's unlikely to happen.’</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well something people once thought far-fetched is now a reality and that's <strong>maglev</strong> – that's short for magnetic levitation and is how some of the world's fastest trains travel.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Finally, we discussed the word <strong>vacuum</strong>. It's a space that has had all the air and other gases removed from it – basically an empty space. 'The plan for Virgin's Hyperloop One is to make a maglev even faster by putting it in a vacuum tube.'

Dan and Neil discuss this trend and teach you six items of vocabulary., 01 Feb 2018,"<p><em>Note: This is not a word for word transcript</em></p><p><br/><strong>Dan</strong><br/>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Dan and joining me today is Neil. Hi Neil.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Hi there, Dan.</p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/>You're a married man, Neil. When you were wed, did your wife change her family name?</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Yes she did.</p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/>Was that her choice?</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Oh yes. She didn't like her old name, so for her it was a win-win. How about you?</p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/>Well, my wife wanted to keep her surname, but was forced to adopt mine because that was the law where we got married.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Would you have thought about taking her name?</p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/>That's what we're talking about in this 6 Minute English. A husband taking a wife's name after marriage. All that, six related words and our quiz question.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>OK. Let's have the question.</p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/>In which country has it been forbidden since 1789 for a citizen to change their name legally, even after marriage?</p><p>a) Japan<br/>b) France<br/>c) Turkey</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>I'm going to go for b) France</p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/>And we'll see if you're right later. Now, traditionally in the UK, when a man and a woman get married, the woman takes the man's family name. And this replaces her <strong>maiden name</strong>.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>A maiden name is the surname a woman had before she was married. This all dates back to the Norman invasion of England, back in 1066. They introduced the idea that when a woman married a man, she became his property. As a result of this, she took his name.</p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/>These days, many women elect to keep their maiden name upon marriage or combine it with their new husband's in some way, sometimes by making the name <strong>double-barrelled</strong>.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>A double-barrelled name is two names that are connected by a hyphen, such as Jones-Smith.</p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/>However, a growing number of couples in western culture are doing it differently . When they get married, the husband elects to take the wife's surname.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>In a BBC article about surnames and marriage, Rory Dearlove, formerly Rory Cook, talks about why he decided to take his wife's surname. He said that he wasn't really attached to his name anyway. To him it didn't make any difference.</p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/>Well, he's not alone. A recent study of 2000 UK adults by Opinium, a strategic insight agency, suggested that one in ten millennial men, currently between 18 and 34 years old, fall into this category.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Charlie Shaw, a Tibetan Buddhist meditation instructor, who took his wife's name when they married last year, said that it was an opportunity to acknowledge the unseen <strong>patriarchal</strong> bias and sexism in our society.</p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/>Patriarchal means 'controlled by men' and a <strong>bias</strong> is the unfair support or opposition to a person, thing or idea.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Many traditional societies were patriarchal. But modern UK society is less like that. Everyone is meant to be equal.</p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/>Ah yes, but that's the unseen part. And there's the social view of things too. Rachel Robnett, a researcher at the University of Nevada surveyed a number of people in the US and UK, and found that the husbands of women who keep their maiden names are viewed as 'feminine', while the women are believed to '<strong>wear the trousers</strong>'.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>If you 'wear the trousers' in a relationship, it means you 'have the control and make the decisions for both people'.</p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/>I wondered about that, so I went out into London and asked people what they thought about a man who took his wife's name when they got married. Here's what they said.</p><p><strong>Woman</strong><br/>I don't think it's a bad idea at all. My dad's 55 and he took my mother's surname. If people want to do it, then all the power to them.</p><p><strong>Man</strong><br/>It's each to their own really. It doesn't hurt anybody. And it's no different from a woman taking a man's name.</p><p><strong>Woman</strong><br/>The only reason I think that anybody should take someone else's surname if just for the creation of a family unit. But if it's just out of principle, I don't agree.</p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/>It seems that the people I talked to are comfortable with the idea.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Yes. Most said that people are free to do what they want. One woman even mentioned the creation of a family <strong>unit</strong>.</p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/>A unit is a group of people living or working together. A typical family unit would be two parents and some children. Well, that answers that question. People don't seem to mind who takes who's name.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Speaking of questions. How about our quiz question?</p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/>Oh yes, I asked you in which country it's been forbidden since 1789 for a citizen to change their name legally, even after marriage?</p><p>a) Japan<br/>b) France<br/>c) Turkey</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>And I said b)France</p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/>And you were spot on as usual, Neil.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Let's take a look at the vocabulary, shall we?</p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/>First we had <strong>maiden name</strong>. This is a woman's family name before she is married. My mother refused to give up her maiden name to my father when she got married.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Then we had <strong>double-barrelled</strong>. A double-barrelled name is two names that are joined by a hyphen. Can you think of any famous examples?</p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/>Well, there's the Duchess of Cornwall Camilla Parker-Bowles for one. She's married to Prince Charles – next in line to the English throne. Then we had <strong>patriarchal</strong>. If something is patriarchal, it is controlled by men. The feminine equivalent is matriarchal, controlled by women.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Then we had <strong>bias</strong>. A bias is unfair support or opposition to a person, thing or idea.</p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/>Many fans are biased in favour of their football team. Then we had <strong>wear the trousers</strong>. If you wear the trousers, you have the control and make the decisions for both people.

I'm Dan and joining me today is Neil. Hi Neil.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Hi Dan. What’s with the protective gear and helmet?</p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/>I’m just getting ready for the inevitable rise of the machines. That’s the takeover of the world by artificial intelligence, or AI, which some people predict will happen.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Inevitable means cannot be avoided or stopped. Rise of the machines? What do you mean?</p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/>It’s our topic in this 6 Minute English. We’ll be talking about that, giving you six related pieces of vocabulary and, of course, our regular quiz question.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>That’s the first thing you’ve said that makes any sense. What’s the question?</p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/>The word ‘robot’ as we use it today was first used in a 1920’s Czech play ‘Rossum’s Universal Robots’. But before this, what was its original meaning?<br/>a) forced labour<br/>b) metal man<br/>c) heartless thing</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>I will go for a) forced labour</p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/>We’ll find out if you were right or not later in the show.<br/><br/><strong>Neil</strong><br/>OK Dan. Tell me what’s going on.</p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/>I saw a news article written by BBC technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones about the recent CES technology show in Las Vegas. He interviewed David Hanson, founder of Hanson Robotics, who said it was his ambition to achieve an AI that can beat humans at any intellectual task.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Surely it’s a good thing! Better AI and robotics could take over many of the jobs that we don’t want to do, or that are so important to get 100% right… like air traffic control. We’d never have another plane crash. It would be infallible because it would be so clever.</p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/>Infallible means never failing. And that’s what bothers me. What happens when its intelligence surpasses ours? Why should it do what we want it to do?</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>To surpass something is to do or be better than it. Dan, you’ve been watching too many movies. Robots fighting humanity is a popular theme. Guess what… humanity often wins. And besides, we would programme the computer to be benevolent.</p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/>Benevolent means kind and helpful. But that’s just it, once the intelligence becomes sentient, or able to think for itself, who knows what it will do. We humans are not exactly perfect, you know. What happens if it decides that it is better than us and wants us out of the way?</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Don’t worry. Asimov thought of that. Isaac Asimov was an American science fiction writer who, among other things, wrote about robots. He came up with three laws that every robot would have to follow to stop it from acting against humanity. So we’re safe!</p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/>I’m not so sure. A sentient robot could make up its own mind about how to interpret the laws. For example, imagine if we created an AI system to protect all of humanity.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Well, that’s great! No more war. No more murder. No more fighting.</p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/>Do you really think that humans can stop fighting? What if the AI decides that the only way to stop us from hurting ourselves and each other is to control everything we do, so it takes over to protect us. Then we would lose our freedom to a thing that we created that is infallible and more intelligent than we are! That’s the end, Neil!</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>I think that’s a little far-fetched, which means difficult to believe. I’m sure others don’t think that way.</p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/>OK. Let’s hear what the Learning English team say when I ask them if they are worried that AI and robots could take over the world.</p><p><strong>Insert</strong><br/><strong>Phil</strong><br/>Well, it’s possible, but unlikely. There will come a point where our technology will be limited – probably before real AI is achieved.</p><p><strong>Sam</strong><br/>Never in a million years. First of all we’d programme them so that they couldn’t, and secondly we’d beat them anyway. Haven’t you ever seen a movie?</p><p><strong>Kee</strong><br/>I totally think it could happen. We only have to make a robot that’s smart enough to start thinking for itself. After that, who knows what it might do.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>A mixed bag of opinions there, Dan. It seems you aren’t alone.</p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/>Nope. But I don’t exactly have an army of support either. I guess we’ll just have to wait and see.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Speak for yourself. I’ve waited long enough – for our quiz question that is.</p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/>Oh yeah! I asked you what the original meaning of the word ‘robot’ was before it was used in its modern form.<br/>a) forced labour<br/>b) metal man<br/>c) heartless thing</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>And I said a) forced labour</p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/>And you were… right!<br/><br/><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Shall we take a look at the vocabulary then?</p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/>OK. First we had inevitable. If something is inevitable then it cannot be avoided or stopped. Can you think of something inevitable, Neil?</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>It is inevitable that one day the Sun will stop burning. Then we had infallible, which means never failing. Give us an example, Dan.</p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/>The vaccine for small pox is infallible. The natural spread of that disease has been completely stopped. After that was surpasses. If something surpasses something else then it becomes better than it.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Many parents across the world hope that their children will surpass them in wealth, status or achievement. After that we heard benevolent, which means kind and helpful. Name a person famous for being benevolent, Dan.</p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/>Father Christmas is a benevolent character. After that we heard sentient. If something is sentient, it is able to think for itself.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Indeed. Many people wonder about the possibility of sentient life on other planets. Finally we heard far-fetched, which means difficult to believe. Like that far-fetched story you told me the other day about being late because of a dragon, Dan.</p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/>I swear it was real! It had big sharp teeth and everything!</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Yeah, yeah, yeah. And that’s the end of this 6 Minute English.

But what are the real benefits of going dry and is just one month long enough?", 18 Jan 2018,"<p><em>Note: This is not a word for word transcript</em></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English– the show that brings you an interesting topic, authentic listening practice and vocabulary to help you improve your language skills. I'm Rob…</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And I'm Catherine. In this programme we'll be discussing <strong>quitting</strong> drinking and staying dry.  </p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Right, so when you say ‘quitting’, you mean ‘giving up’ – and when you say ‘drinking’, you're particularly referring to ‘the activity of drinking alcohol’.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Exactly Rob.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>But, what about staying dry? It's nothing to do with the weather?</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>No that's true. The adjective ‘dry’ here means ‘no alcohol’. And I, Rob, am currently having a dry January.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Ah yes, your New Year's <strong>resolution</strong> is to give up alcohol for one month. Any reason?</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Yes. I'm doing it in order to improve my health and save some money. And a resolution, by the way, is a promise to yourself to do something or not to do something. </p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well they seem like good reasons. And for now, we must keep up our resolution to always start the programme with a question, so are you ready for it, Catherine?</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>I am, crack on, Rob!</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>According to data from the World Health Organisation in 2015, which country consumed the most alcohol per person? Was it…</p><p>a)    Australia</p><p>b)    Finland</p><p>c)    The Czech Republic</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Well they're sound quite likely, but I did visit Prague once and I had a lovely time, so I'm going to say c) the Czech Republic.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>OK, well as always, we'll find out the answer later on. But let's continue our discussion about drinking – or informally known as boozing – and trying to give it up. We all know that too much drinking can be bad for us and that's why you Catherine, have decided to quit – but only for a month.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Yes just a month but it's a start and I might continue into February. But I'm seeing the benefits already. I've managed <strong>to shed</strong> some weight – most of which I actually put on over Christmas!</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>I can see. So <strong>to shed</strong> here simply means 'lose'. And I bet your <strong>sobriety</strong> is helping you sleep better. Sobriety, by the way, means ‘the state of not being drunk’.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>It is actually. And I'm not alone: A study of 857 British adults by Dr Richard de Visser from the University of Sussex found that after going for a month without alcohol, 62% of the people in the study said they had better sleep. So Rob, does that tempt you to become teetotal and stop drinking?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Not me Catherine. I need a drink to help me relax and be more sociable – you know how shy I am!</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Yes of course Rob! Well, maybe you should listen to Catherine Gray. She's the author of a book called The Unexpected Joy of Being Sober, which she wrote after she discovered the negative effects of going to too many work-related parties where she was just drinking too much. Here she is speaking on BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour programme…</p><p><strong>Catherine Gray, author of The Unexpected Joy of Being Sober<br/></strong>I had a lot of social anxiety and when I quit I had to deal with that. I think I used drinking as a <strong>crutch</strong>, a confidence crutch - it eased the way to go to big glittering parties and stuff like that and when I quit I had to learn real confidence in a way.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/> </strong>So Catherine worked in the magazine business which involved going to lots of boozy parties. Drinking, she says, helped herdeal with a nervous and worried feeling that she had when she met new people - she called it social anxiety.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes, and she used drinking as a <strong>crutch</strong>. A crutch here is something you depend on for support – and sometimes you rely on it too much.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Yes and eventually she decided to <strong>abstain</strong> from drinking – in other words stop doing something that is enjoyable but bad for you – and she feels much better for it. So come on Rob, haven't you got the willpower to just quit drinking for just 30 days?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well according to Catherine Gray, that wouldn't be long enough…</p><p><strong>Catherine Gray, author of The Unexpected Joy of Being Sober<br/> </strong>Experts say that it takes 66 days for a new habit to <strong>bed in</strong>, so I would always recommend trying it for 90 days. 30 days is the hard bit before you get to the rewards. Because after 66 days it starts getting a lot easier and you start feeling better in yourself.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Right, so it takes 66 days for doing a regular activity - a habit - to <strong>bed in</strong>. And ‘bed in’ means to ‘become normal and start working properly’.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Now, earlier I asked you, according to data from the World Health Organisation in 2015, which country consumed the most alcohol per person? Was it…</p><p>a)    Australia</p><p>b)    Finland</p><p>c)    The Czech Republic</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And I said the Czech Republic. Was I right?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>You were Catherine. Spot on, well done. Apparently, 14.1 litres of pure alcohol is consumed per person each year.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Well like I said, they do make good beer in the Czech Republic – but people, be careful, only drink it in moderation. Now Rob, shall we take a look at the vocabulary we've mentioned today?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Indeed. The first word we had was <strong>resolution</strong> – that's a promise to yourself to do or not do something. 'Catherine's New Year's resolution was to give up drinking alcohol for a whole month.'</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Yes, and I'm still doing it Rob – the plan is <strong>to shed</strong> a few kilos and get fit. So for example, 'Rob shed lots of weight when he went on a cake-free diet!'</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Really? I'd never give up cake Catherine, but I could be tempted to give up booze as I know <strong>sobriety </strong>is good for my health – that's the noun word to mean ‘the state of not being drunk’.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Now our next word was <strong>abstain</strong>. That means ‘not do something that is enjoyable but bad for you’. 'Rob needs to abstain from eating cakes if he wants to wear his skinny jeans.'</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/> Are you dropping a hint there, Catherine?  Now, our final word is actually two words – <strong>bed in</strong>. It means ‘to become normal and start working properly’. 'It took a while for the new computer system to bed in but now it's working perfectly.'</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>That's brilliant because now we can go online and find more BBC Learning English programmes at bbclearningenglish.com. That's all for today's 6 Minute English. We hope you enjoyed it. Bye for now.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Bye.</p>",Transcript,<p><strong>resolution<br/></strong>a promise to yourself to do or not do something</p><p><strong>to shed<br/> </strong>to lose</p><p><strong>sobriety </strong><br/> the state of not being drunk</p><p><strong>crutch<br/> </strong>crutch here is something you depend on for support</p><p><strong>abstain<br/> </strong>not do something that is enjoyable but bad for you</p><p><strong>bed in</strong><br/>to become normal and start working properly</p>,Vocabulary

I'm Dan and joining me today is Catherine. Hey Catherine.<br/><br/><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Hey Dan.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>So Catherine, do you prefer a brew or a cup of joe in the morning?</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Well, if you are referring to whether I prefer a cup of tea, which we sometimes call ‘a brew’, or a cup of coffee, sometimes called ‘a cup of joe’, I prefer my coffee in the morning.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>I only drink coffee when I really need to wake up quickly.  </p><p><strong>Catherine<br/> </strong>And, why are you asking, Dan?</p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/> Because it’s part of this 6 Minute English.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Coffee. I see. So how do you take it then, Dan?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Well, I’m an instant coffee kind of guy. And I like mine with a <strong>dash</strong> of milk. How about you?</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>A <strong>dash</strong> of something is a small amount of something, especially liquid. Personally, I prefer freshly-ground coffee beans, and I like my coffee dark and strong -  preferably Colombian or maybe Brazilian.</p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/> Wow. A coffee <strong>aficionado</strong>, eh?</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>An <strong>aficionado </strong>is a person who’s very enthusiastic about, or interested in, a particular subject.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Well, let me test your knowledge with this week’s quiz question. The specialty coffee, Kopi luwak, is made from coffee beans which have already passed through an animal’s digestive system. But which animal?</p><p>a)    an elephant</p><p>b)    a cat</p><p>c)    a weasel</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>I’m always going to answer b) a cat. Did you say this coffee actually goes through the animal? As in, it eats it and then it comes out the other end, and that’s what we use for the coffee?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Well, yes. It is actually one of the most expensive coffees in the world. Anyway, we’ll find out if you’re right or not later on. So, talking of expensive, do you tend to pay more for your coffee or are you happy with the <strong>cheap as chips</strong> stuff?</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong><strong>Cheap as chips</strong> means very cheap. And personally, I do actually like a quality product, and I am willing to pay a bit more for it.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Would you be willing to pay even more than you already do if it meant that the farmer who grew the beans was getting a fairer price?</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>I would because I think that that sort of thing is important.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>And you aren’t alone.  There is a growing trend among many Western customers of artisan cafes to be willing to pay more for ethically produced coffee.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong><strong>Ethical</strong> means morally right. So, Dan, why is this trend happening at the moment? </p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Well, it’s probably been going on for a while, but a new report from the UN’s World Intellectual Property Organisation has observed the effect that smarter processing, branding and marketing has had on the farmers and their communities.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And because of this, coffee drinkers are better able to choose ethically produced coffee that puts more money in the hands of the farmers. But, Dan, do the farmers actually see any of this money?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Well, it’s complicated. The price of the coffee is relatively cheap until it’s been <strong>roasted</strong> – or cooked in an oven. As a result, roasters take most of the profits. But there is still a difference. I’ll let Johnathan Josephs, a business reporter for the BBC News explain.</p><p><strong>INSERT</strong><br/> <strong>Jonathan Josephs , Business reporter, BBC News<br/> </strong>For a pound of coffee beans that end up in the instants (section) sold in supermarkets, the roaster can get over $4. But the export price is just $1.45. The farmer gets most of that. But when the new wave of socially-aware customer pays a <strong>premium</strong> for higher standards, the roaster can get $17.45, but the export price also rises to $5.14.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>A <strong>premium</strong> is an amount that’s more than usual. So the farmer makes three-and-a-half times as much money.</p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/> Which means a better quality of life for the farmer, their family and their community.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/> </strong>That’s good news! I will definitely look for the ethically produced coffee from now on. As long as, Dan, it doesn’t come out of some animal!</p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/>Yes, actually that reminds me. Our quiz question. I asked you which animal the speciality coffee Kopi luwak comes from.</p><p>a)    an elephant</p><p>b)    a cat</p><p>c)    a weasel</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And I said a cat.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>And you are wrong I’m afraid. Kopi luwak comes from a type of weasel.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>I’m kind of relieved about that.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Let’s try not to think about it, and have a look at the vocabulary instead.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>OK. So, first we had <strong>dash</strong>. A <strong>dash</strong> of something is a small amount of something, usually a liquid. Where might we talk about a dash of something, Dan?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Well, I like my tea with a dash of milk. My gin with a dash of tonic, and my soup with a dash of salt. Then we had <strong>aficionado</strong>. An <strong>aficionado</strong> is someone who is very interested or enthusiastic about a subject. What are you an aficionado of?</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>I’m working on becoming a bit of an accordion aficionado actually, Dan.</p><p><strong>Dan <br/></strong>Wow, cool!</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Yeah! After that, we had <strong>as cheap as chips</strong>. Is something <strong>as cheap as chips</strong>? Then it is very cheap indeed.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Like my shoes! I bought them at a market for next to nothing. They were as cheap as chips. Then we had <strong>ethical</strong>. Something which is <strong>ethical</strong> is morally right. Do you consider yourself to be an ethical person, Catherine?</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Well, I try, Dan. I don’t always get it right, but I do attempt to be. After that we heard <strong>roasted</strong>. <strong>Roasted </strong>means cooked in an oven. Like our coffee beans!</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>And of course our very famous English roast. Finally, we had a <strong>premium.</strong> If you pay a premium, you pay more than usual - usually for a better quality or service. Can you think of an example?</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>If you’re going to the cinema, you might pay a premium to get more comfortable seats.</p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/> And that’s the end of this 6 Minute English. Don’t forget to check out our YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram pages, and we’ll see you next time.

It’s something that makes the world go round, but it doesn’t really exist. In fact, if we all stopped believing in it, it would have no use at all! What is it?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I haven’t got a clue!</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Ok...how about this? </p><p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>Money!<br/> <br/> <strong>Dan</strong><br/> Yep! And not just any money, we’re talking about crypto-<strong>currency</strong>.<br/> <br/> <strong>Neil<br/></strong><strong>Currency </strong>is the money that’s being used in a given country at a certain time. But what about the cryptopart?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Well, crypto is a prefix meaning hidden or secret – it comes from the word <strong>cryptic </strong>which means mysterious or difficult to understand. You may have heard about the most popular crypto-currency at the moment, the Bitcoin.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well I’ve certainly heard the name, but I can’t say I know what it is.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/> </strong>First our quiz question. When was the Bitcoin crypto-currency first created?</p><p>a)    2004</p><p>b)    2009</p><p>c)    2013</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, I think 2004 may have been a little early, and I think 2013 could be a little late, so the smart money’s on 2009.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>We’ll see if you’re right later on in the show. So…Bitcoin, what do you know about it?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, I know it’s a digital currency…so presumably you can use it online to buy things?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>You are right on the money, which means correct, both times. Bitcoin is just like any other currency except for two things. First, it’s not printed by governments or banks, which means that it’s not <strong>legal tender.</strong></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong><strong>Legal tender</strong> means the official money that can be used within a country. So that means we can’t use it to pay taxes or settle debts, right?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Exactly. Governments won’t recognise it as an official currency, although it acts just like one. You can use it to buy items from anyone who will accept it, and its value <strong>fluctuates</strong>.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong><strong>Fluctuates</strong> means changes in level or amount. And what’s the second thing?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Ah, the second thing is that bitcoin is a digital currency, meaning that with the exception of a few tokens, it largely exists online only. You can’t carry a load of bitcoins around in your pocket!</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, that makes a nice…change! </p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Oh dear, Neil. Was that a money pun? Terrible!</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So if it’s a digital only currency, where do new ones come from? Can’t I just say that I’ve got a million of them and make myself rich!?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Well, no. You see, even though Bitcoin is not regulated by a bank or government, it still has a process that stops people from cheating. There are only two ways to get bitcoins. You either trade them from someone, or you go mining.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/> Oh wait, I've heard about this. This is when you use your computer to run calculations which verify other Bitcoin transactions. You get rewarded for this ‘work’ by earning bitcoins.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Yep! It’s money for old rope, which means it’s an easy way to earn money.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Wow! I’m going to start mining immediately!</p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/> Well, you wouldn’t be the only one! Bitcoin’s value has recently gone up quite a lot and this has caused a lot of interest. In fact, one stock exchange in Chicago has begun trading in Bitcoin futures contracts.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>A futures contract? What’s that?<br/> <br/> <strong>Dan</strong><br/> I’ll let BBC correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones explain that.</p><p><strong> INSERT</strong><br/><strong>Rory Cellan-Jones, BBC correspondent<br/> </strong>A futures contract, a bet on where the currency will be a month from now, <strong>soared</strong> above 18,000 dollars. That means that investors believe Bitcoin, which started the year worth under 1000 dollars will continue to rise in value, albeit at a slower rate.  But at the big banks there’s still plenty of scepticism about the currency.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong><strong>Soared</strong> in this context means increased very quickly. So, now big investors are betting on the value of Bitcoin in the future.</p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/> Yes. But he also mentioned that the banks have a lot of <strong>scepticism</strong>. That's a doubt that something is real or true. In this case, whether Bitcoin is reliable or not.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Maybe it’s best I don’t get involved then. After all, a fool and his money are soon parted.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Well, you don’t have to be sceptical about the answer to our quiz. We know that for a fact. I asked you when the Bitcoin crypto-currency was first created.</p><p>a)    2004</p><p>b)    2009</p><p>c)    2013</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I said 2009.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>And you were right! Well done. Shall we go over the vocabulary again?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>First we had <strong>currency</strong>. That’s the money being used in a given country at a certain time. Name three currencies and their countries, Dan.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Ok. Baht for Thailand. Rupee for India and my favourite, Metical for Mozambique. Next we had <strong>cryptic</strong>. Something which is cryptic is mysterious or difficult to understand. For example, what do rich people need, poor people have and if you eat it, you die?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>A cryptic riddle indeed! I’ll have to think about that. Then we had <strong>legal tender</strong>, that’s the official money that can be used within a country. The Euro is legal tender within Spain, but what was the legal tender before that?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Wasn’t it the Peseta? Then we had <strong>fluctuates</strong>. If something fluctuates, it changes in amount or level. The stock market fluctuates.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>But my love for my family never does. Then we had <strong>soared</strong>, which means increased very quickly. It’s used with this meaning in the context of money, prices and statistics.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Finally we had <strong>scepticism</strong>. <strong>Scepticism</strong> is doubt that something is real or true. What sort of things are people sceptical about, Neil?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Some people think that human activity hasn’t caused climate change. They are sceptical.</p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/> And that brings us to the end of today’s 6 Minute English.

Many men say their illness is real, while many women say they are just being weak. But why is it that some men seem to suffer, or complain, more when they get sick than women?", 28 Dec 2017,"<p><em>Note: This is not a word for word transcript</em></p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Dan, and joining me today is Neil. Hi Neil.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Hi, everyone!</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Bless you! Are you ok?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I think I’m coming down with something serious.</p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/> It’s just a case of <strong>the sniffles</strong>. <br/> <br/> <strong>Neil</strong><br/> <strong>The</strong> <strong>sniffles</strong> is an informal way of saying a cold or flu. It comes from the sniffing sound people make when they have <strong>a runny nose</strong>.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>And a <strong>runny nose</strong> is when liquid mucus keeps leaking from our nose – usually when we are sick. I’m afraid you’ll just have to <strong>soldier on</strong> Neil.  </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong><strong>To soldier on </strong>means to continue despite difficulty. I’m dying! What’s it about anyway?</p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/> It’s about ‘man flu’, and whether it’s actually real, or just something men like to complain about. We'll give you 6 words and expressions – and, of course, our quiz question.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Alright, fire away.</p><p><strong>Dan <br/></strong>In a survey conducted by Nuts magazine that asked its readers how long they took to recover from a cold or flu, where women put an average of 1.5 days, what did men put?</p><p>a) 1 day</p><p>b) 2 days</p><p>c) 3 days</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I’m going to say 3 days. The threat of ‘man flu’ is real.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Well, we’ll find out later, but let’s clarify. ‘<strong>Man flu</strong>’ is the tendency that many people believe men have to complain about a minor illness, such as a cold or flu, and act as if they were suffering from something a lot more serious.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes. But science cannot say whether men do actually suffer more than women, or if men just tend to complain more.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Well, let’s hear from this British couple about whether they think ‘man flu’ is real or not.</p><p><strong>Vox<br/></strong><strong>British Man<br/></strong>Men definitely do suffer a lot more, I think, than women do when we get flu.</p><p><strong>British Woman</strong><br/> Yeah, I’m not so convinced. I feel like they just complain more.</p><p><strong>British Man</strong><br/> It wipes me out.<br/> <strong><br/>British Woman<br/></strong>I was ill recently and I just carried on and went to work and everything. And when Chris had got sick recently he was on the sofa and couldn’t really do anything, so…</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>And it seems that it’s not just in the UK. Listen to this BBC Journalist interviewing a woman from Europe.</p><p><strong>Vox<br/></strong><strong>BBC Journalist<br/></strong>You’re from the Netherlands. Have you ever accused your boyfriend of having man flu?</p><p><strong>Dutch woman<br/></strong>Oh, absolutely yes. Yeah.</p><p><strong>BBC Journalist<br/></strong>What have you accused him of doing?</p><p><strong>Dutch woman<br/></strong>…<strong>whining</strong>?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong><strong>Whining</strong> is when someone complains repeatedly and often in an annoying way about something. So, there certainly seems to be something there…but nothing has been proven, right?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Well, a recent scientific study has indicated that there could be something to ‘man flu’ after all. Doctor Kyle Sue, an assistant professor of family medicine at Memorial University of Newfoundland in Canada, has suggested that there could be a difference between men and women when it comes to respiratory diseases.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Respiratory meaning related to breathing. He says that there was already a lot of evidence from existing studies suggesting men experience worse, longer-lasting <strong>symptoms</strong>.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong><strong>Symptoms</strong> are the feelings of illness caused by a disease. Listen to him explain why this is.</p><p><strong>Doctor Kyle Sue</strong>,<br/><strong>Memorial University, Newfoundland</strong><br/> It seems that the higher the testosterone levels, the lower the immune response to these types of infections, whereas the higher the oestrogen level, the stronger the immune response.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/> Testosterone and oestrogen are hormones that exist in both men and women. Testosterone is higher in males and oestrogen is higher in females. Dr. Sue’s research suggests that the more oestrogen a person has, the better able they are to fight off the infection. That’s it then! Man flu is real!<br/> <br/> <strong>Dan<br/> </strong>Hold your horses, Neil. There are two problems. First of all, the Royal college of GPs in the UK says that there is no such thing as ‘man flu’. And secondly, even Dr Sue admits that these results, including his own, are only ‘suggestive’ and are not ‘definitive’.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So, basically he’s saying that there is a suggestion that ‘man flu’ exists, but the evidence so far cannot say for sure.</p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/> Exactly. More studies need to be done. But you know what we can be sure about? The answer to this week’s quiz question. I asked you in a survey conducted by Nuts magazine that asked its readers how long they took to recover from a cold or flu, where women put an average of 1.5 days, what did men put?</p><p>a) 1 day</p><p>b) 2 days</p><p>c) 3 days</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I said 3 days.</p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/> And you were right!</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/> Good!<br/> <br/> <strong>Dan</strong><br/> The men said they took twice as long to recover!<br/> <br/> <strong>Neil</strong><br/> It must be all that manly testosterone. Let’s review our vocabulary, shall we? </p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Our first was <strong>the sniffles</strong>. If you have the sniffles, you have a cold, informally speaking. What's the best cure for <strong>the sniffles</strong> Neil?</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/> Stay in bed and sweat it out, my mum always said. Just make sure you have lots of tissues to deal with your <strong>runny nose</strong>. That’s when a person’s nose leaks mucus, usually because they are ill. Yuck!</p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/> Next we had <strong>soldier on</strong>. This phrasal verb means to continue despite difficulty. When was the last time you had to <strong>soldier on</strong>, Neil?<br/> <br/> <strong>Neil</strong><br/> A few days ago when I went the whole day without eating any lunch! Then we had ‘<strong>man flu</strong>’. That’s is the name given to the situation where a person, often a man, tends to complain and exaggerate a small illness such as a cold. Do you do that, Dan?<br/> <br/> <strong>Dan</strong><br/> I’m sure my wife would say I do! Next we had <strong>whining</strong>. If you <strong>whine</strong>, you complain repeatedly and often in an annoying way. <br/> <br/> <strong>Neil</strong><br/> Like my children did last time I didn’t buy them ice-cream. And finally we had <strong>symptoms</strong>. These are the feelings of illness caused by a disease. What are the symptoms of flu, Dan?<br/> <br/> <strong>Dan</strong><br/> A headache, aching muscles, and a fever. And that’s the end of this 6 Minute English!

As you enjoy giving presents so much, I'm very pleased to have you with me in this 6 Minute English – Our topic… What makes the perfect Santa? We'll have 6 items of vocabulary for you and, of course, our quiz question. Ready?</p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/>Hit me.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>How many Santas are there in the world?</p><p>a) 1,500<br/><br/>b) 15,000<br/><br/>c) 15 million</p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/>I know there are a lot but 15 million must be wrong; 1,500 seems too few, so I'll go for 15,000.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>We'll see if you're right at the end of the programme. Dan, you seem like a strong <strong>candidate</strong> for a job as Santa. Ever considered it?</p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/>I'd love to! A candidate is a person competing for a job.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>And what do you think is a key part of being Santa – or Father Christmas as we also call him in the UK?</p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/>You've already mentioned being jolly…</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>I have. Let's listen to James Lovell, who runs a Santa school at his company Ministry of Fun in London. What does he say is the key?</p><p><strong>James Lovell</strong><br/>A perfect 'ho ho ho!' is a key part of being a Father Christmas. It's a ho ho ho! And it needs to just reinforce the fact that you are the jolliest person on the planet. So I like to reach down into my tummy, tap it and with a big smile on my face go ho ho hoooo!</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>The perfect ho ho ho! You need that to <strong>reinforce</strong> the fact you are the jolliest person in the world.</p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/>To reinforce means to make something stronger. Ho ho ho!</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Wow, Dan! You're very convincing. Are you sure you've never done this before?</p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/>I haven't but I want to. It feels good! Ho ho ho!</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>I could be the ideal career move for you, Dan. But I bet it's not all fun.</p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/>Hmm, maybe. I think there would be a lot of <strong>pressure</strong> to perform. Pressure is the feeling of worry you can get when you are expected to deal with a difficult situation.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Yes, think of all the children you have to impress. Pressure indeed. Let's hear from James Lovell again, who runs a Santa school in London.</p><p><strong>James Lovell</strong><br/><strong>Portraying</strong> Father Christmas is not an easy job because when you're dressed as Father Christmas, you have a huge responsibility to <strong>recreate</strong> the magic of the real Santa in every way. You need to look good, you need to have lots to say and you need to be incredibly jolly and you need to have magical eyes.</p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/>So it seems I was right: <strong>portraying</strong> Father Christmas is not an easy job. Portraying meaning playing the part of – like an actor does.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>He says there's a huge responsibility to <strong>recreate</strong> the magic of the real Santa. To recreate means to make something exist again.</p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/>All those kids expecting that magical moment – and it's all down to you as Santa! Hmm I'm beginning to have second thoughts about this career change…</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Could you handle the pressure?</p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/>I'm not sure I could! Portraying Father Christmas might be a challenge too far – despite my ho ho ho!</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Now it's time to find out the answer to our quiz question. I asked how many Santas there are in the world?</p><p>a) 1,500<br/><br/>b) 15,000<br/><br/>c) 15 million</p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/>I said b) 15,000</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>And you were… wrong! I'm afraid it was a trick question – there is, of course, only one Santa!</p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/>Ahhh that's not fair!</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Sorry! Shall we have a recap of the vocabulary?</p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/>Yes please – that would make me jolly again.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Jolly, meaning happy and smiley. What makes you jolly, Dan?</p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/>Christmas of course! Now Neil, I have to say, cheating me out of that quiz question was really not in the spirit of 6 Minute English. We are always nice to each other.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Ah yes, you're probably right. Spirt here has the sense of something's real meaning. The spirit of 6 Minute English is friendly educational fun – not cheating your colleagues!</p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/>Glad we've got that straight. Our next word is candidate. Until you made me think about how hard it is to be a good Santa, I thought I'd be a strong candidate for the job.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>A candidate is a person competing for a job. Next we had reinforce.</p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/>Reinforce means to make something stronger. Repeating the vocabulary in 6 Minute English reinforces your ability to remember it!</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>That's right – and it puts you under less pressure when you're speaking English if you have a good range of vocabulary.</p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/>Pressure is the feeling of worry you can get when you are expected to deal with a difficult situation – like pretending to be Santa! Yes there's a lot of pressure involved in portraying someone else.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Portraying, meaning playing the part of someone – like an actor does. It can be very difficult to get it right.</p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/>Yep, it's a real skill to be able to recreate the look and character of another person. Recreate meaning to make something exist again.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Well we'll try our best to recreate a positive learning experience for you all next time on 6 Minute English.

I'm Neil and joining me today is Dan who is a producer at BBC Learning English – that's his job.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Hi everyone… Yes that is my job, obviously – why are we discussing that now, Neil?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well you haven't always been a producer at BBC Learning English, have you?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>No… I used to be a teacher.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/> And before that? Way back – your first ever job?<br/> <br/> <strong>Dan</strong><br/> Ah, I had a <strong>paper round</strong> when I was 14. A paper round is a job – the job of delivering newspapers to people's homes. It's often done by teenagers.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>14 seems very young to be at work. And that's the topic of this 6 Minute English: Should schoolchildren have jobs? It seems fewer and fewer are these days, according to the statistics. We'll give you 6 job-related words and expressions – and, of course, our quiz question. You Ready?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>You bet!</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>What is the youngest age at which children are allowed to work in the UK?  </p><p>a) 12</p><p>b) 13</p><p>c) 14</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Well, I'm going to say 14 just because that's how old I was and it seems a long time ago!</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>We'll find out at the end of the programme.  Let's start by hearing some British teenagers talking about their <strong>Saturday jobs</strong>.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>A Saturday job is the name we give to part-time work that teenagers do for extra money. As the name suggests, these jobs often take place on Saturdays – but not always.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>That's right -  'Saturday job' is general term we use to describe part-time work done by teenagers. The work might take place on Sundays or any day of the week, in fact! Let's hear from these British children about their Saturday jobs.</p><p><strong>Insert Vox<br/></strong>We have to face all the stuff on the shelves and make it look organised and show customers where products are if they need to know.</p><p>On the average week I work nine hours, so two hours for two school nights and then I work four hours on a Saturday and two hours on a Sunday. And then in the school holidays I can work more.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>The first kid said the work involves making the shelves look organised. Shop work is a very typical Saturday job.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Oh yes, I spent many a weekend and evening stacking shelves! The second teenager's Saturday job takes place Saturdays, Sundays and evenings. As we said – A Saturday job's not just for Saturdays.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>A Saturday job is seen almost as a <strong>rite of passage</strong> in the UK. A rite of passage is the name we give to events or ceremonies that form an important stage in a person's life.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>That's right – like graduating from school, or having children. But according to the latest statistics in the UK, that is all changing. Listen to this BBC report.</p><p><strong>Insert BBC reporter<br/></strong>In order to work, they need a permit from the local authority and our data shows the number being issued has fallen from nearly 30,000 permits in 2012 to just 23,000 in 2016. Employers frequently <strong>bemoan</strong> the lack of work experience young people have. But teenagers are also facing pressure not to take up part-time jobs and to concentrate on their studies instead.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>So, it seems that fewer teenagers are taking Saturday jobs. But there's a conflict here.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, on the one hand, employers bemoan the lack of work experience young people have. Bemoan, meaning complain about. It's a rather formal word.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>But on the other hand, teenagers are facing pressure not to take part-time jobs and to concentrate on their studies. Some people think working could be <strong>detrimental</strong> to a schoolchild's academic progress.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Detrimental - which means causing harm. It's a tricky one, isn't it? I think my Saturdays spend stacking shelves and serving fish 'n' chips taught me valuable lessons about working with adults and also managing my money. I don't think it was detrimental to my education.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Well, you managed to get a job at BBC Learning English! As for me, my paper round taught me the value of hard work. It didn't <strong>hinder</strong> me. Hinder means to stop someone or something from making progress.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/> Well let's not talk too much in case we hinder our students… On to the answer to our quiz question. I asked this: What is the youngest age at which children are allowed to work in the UK? </p><p>a) 12</p><p>b) 13</p><p>c) 14</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>I said c) 14.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I'm afraid you are wrong. You are allowed to work from the age of 13 in the UK. Exceptions to this rule include TV, theatre and modelling.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Oh well – I guess I should have spent more time at school.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Shall we have a recap of the vocabulary?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Did you have a paper round as a kid, Neil?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>No I didn't, but I did help my best friend James deliver newspapers - in return for a pound. Big money back in the 80s!</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Did you supplement your earnings with a <strong>Saturday job</strong>?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I did. I had a Saturday job in a supermarket and also in a fish 'n' chip shop – but it wasn't always on a Saturday. Free chips! Dan is that a wedding ring on your finger?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Yes it is. Marriage is a rite of passage in many cultures. It is an important stage in a person's life – talking of which, are those your kids on your screensaver?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yep – having children is another example of a rite of passage. See how tired I look!</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Do not bemoan your lack of sleep! Bemoan's a quite formal way of saying 'complain about'.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I think it's OK to bemoan my lack of sleep – it can have a detrimental effect on my health.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Detrimental – meaning harmful.

New research suggests people are more likely to buy things they don't really need when they are sad, bored or stressed. And they'll probably also come to regret their shopping trip.", 07 Dec 2017,"<p><em>Note: This is not a word for word transcript</em></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Hello and welcome to Six Minute English. I'm Neil and joining me today is Dan – who is weighed down with shopping bags and wearing something very… strange. What's going on, Dan?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Hi everyone. Well, I was feeling a bit miserable so I decided to cheer myself up by going shopping!</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well that's lucky because the link between shopping and mood is what we're looking at in this 6 Minute English – and of course we'll be giving you six mood and shopping-related vocabulary items. But first, our quiz:</p><p>Online shoppers in which country spend more per household than consumers in any other country, according to a report from the UK Cards Association?</p><p>a) The USA</p><p>b) Norway</p><p>c) The UK</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Norway seems to come top of lots of lists, so for that reason alone I'm going to say Norway.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>We'll find out at the end of the show. Now, Dan, you said just now that you went shopping because you were feeling down.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>That's right – I like a bit of <strong>retail therapy</strong>.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong><strong>Retail therapy</strong> is a humorous expression which means going shopping to make yourself feel better.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Oh I do that all the time.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, I can see. And you're not alone. According to some research done by the website moneysupermarket.com, people are more likely to buy things they'll later regret when they're feeling sad, bored or stressed.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Well I was feeling a bit <strong>down in the dumps</strong>. And that's a way of saying 'sad'.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Oh dear, Dan. Sorry to hear you've been <strong>down in the dumps</strong>. I only hope you don't also get a <strong>pang</strong> of regret about your purchases when you get them home – the research suggests that you will.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>A <strong>pang</strong> is a sharp pain. We often hear it used figuratively to talk about strong emotions like guilt, regret and <strong>remorse</strong>. You're making me feel worse, Neil</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Sorry Dan – it's all for educational purposes! Our audience will learn from your pain! <strong>Remorse</strong> is like regret – and there's a good expression to describe exactly that bad feeling you get when you realise you don't really need or want the thing you've bought. <strong>Buyer's remorse</strong>.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>OK, OK, OK enough about me. Let's hear from Sam, Phil and Catherine from the Learning English team to see if their mood affects the shopping choices they make. Listen carefully. Can you hear the three types of things they say that they buy when they're <strong>down in the dumps</strong>?</p><p><strong>Insert<br/></strong><strong>Sam<br/></strong>Honestly, I tend to buy food. Anything that will bring me comfort, so it can be any sort of warm drink, hot drink but also anything kind of warm and <strong>cosy</strong> – so like a nice jumper.</p><p><strong>Phil<br/></strong>Definitely, if I've had a bad day at work, or for whatever reason or I feel terrible, tired, I am more likely to buy something on the way home.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Oh when I'm feeling sad, I probably buy a little bit of wine and often something to wear. I find that a bit of <strong>retail therapy</strong> when I'm sad usually <strong>does the trick</strong> at the time, so it makes me feel better. But I do find that when I look in my wardrobe, the things that I bought when I was sad – I never wear them.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Sam, Phil and Catherine there from the BBC Learning English team talking about what kind of things they buy when they're feeling down. What were they?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Food, drink and clothes.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>That's right. Sam mentioned she buys food, warm drinks and a nice jumper to keep her <strong>cosy</strong>. That's the feeling of being warm, comfortable and relaxed.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Catherine also mentioned drinks – this time wine. And she also said that buying clothes <strong>does the trick</strong>. That means achieves the result she intended. She feels down, she buys clothes, she feels better – it <strong>does the trick</strong>.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>But what's interesting is that Catherine said she never wears the clothes she buys when she's feeling sad. That's exactly what the survey found – people regret the purchases they make when they're sad, bored or stressed.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Sounds like a case of <strong>buyer's remorse</strong>.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Indeed. Well, time now for the answer to our quiz question. I asked this: Online shoppers in which country spend more per household than consumers in any other country, according to a report from the UK Cards Association? Is it:</p><p>a) The USA<br/>b) Norway<br/>c) The UK</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>I said b) Norway.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I'm afraid you might need to go and buy some more stuff to cheer you up – you're wrong! The correct answer is the UK. Apparently UK households spent the equivalent of $5,900 (£4,611) using payment cards online in 2015. </p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Well, I hope they were happy when they made those purchases or they may feel the <strong>pang</strong> of regret I'm scared I might get after today's discussion!</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, a good recap of the vocabulary from this programme might <strong>do the trick</strong>.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Shall we start with the first word? Do you ever go in for a bit of <strong>retail therapy</strong>, Neil?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Actually I try to avoid it. Especially after reading this survey – I don't think the happiness you feel after buying something lasts very long. In fact, you can end up feeling <strong>down in the dumps</strong>.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong><strong>Down in the dumps</strong> - meaning sad/unhappy. Yes and a <strong>pang</strong> of regret might follow once you realise you've spent a lot of money on something you don't really need.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>A <strong>pang</strong> is a stab – used here figuratively to mean a sharp pain used to talk about strong emotions. And after the pang can come <strong>buyer's remorse</strong>.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Hmm, I'm beginning to feel buyer's remorse from this leopard skin onesie. Seemed like such a good idea at the time.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well it does look <strong>cozy</strong> – warm comfortable and relaxed, so I think if that's what you wanted, it <strong>does the trick</strong>.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong><strong>Does the trick</strong>, meaning achieves the result you wanted.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>OK before Dan heads off to buy even more stuff he doesn't need, please remember to check out our Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube pages.</p><p><strong>Dan/Neil<br/></strong>Bye!</p>",Transcript,<p><strong>retail therapy <br/> </strong>going shopping to make yourself feel better</p><p><strong>down in the dumps</strong><br/> unhappy</p><p><strong>pang</strong><br/> sharp pain</p><p><strong>buyer's remorse</strong><br/> bad feeling when a person realises they don't need or want the thing you've bought</p><p><strong>cozy</strong><br/> warm comfortable and relaxed feeling</p><p><strong>does the trick</strong><br/> achieves the result you wanted</p>,Vocabulary

I'm Catherine.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And I'm Rob – and today we bring you a techy topic along with six up-to-date vocabulary items.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And today's techy topic is smartphones. So Rob, can you tell me which age group have been buying smartphones at the fastest rate over the last five years here in the UK? Is it…<br/>a) 15-35 year olds,<br/>b) 35-55 year olds or<br/>c) 55-75 year olds?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>It's got to be the youngsters. It's got to be the 15-35 year olds.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Oh well we'll see whether you got that right or wrong later on in the show. Now Rob, a question: how old is your smartphone?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>OK mine, I bought it a couple of years ago.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And are you happy with it?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes, I am. It works just fine – it does everything I need it to do.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>So you're not worried about not having the latest model?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Not at all. My phone works really well – it has all the functionality I need. And I'm not convinced that the latest model offers any more than the one I've got, to be honest.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong><strong>Functionality</strong> refers to the range of functions a computer or other electronic device can perform. So, let's listen now to Andrew Orlowski, from the tech news website The Register. He explains why people are holding onto their phones longer – instead of rushing out to buy the latest model of phone.</p><p><strong>Andrew Orlowski, The Register<br/></strong>What's happened is that prices have gone up at the high end. And it's kind of a cycle where people hang onto their phones for longer, therefore manufacturers charge more. Then people hang onto them longer to justify that higher purchase.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>So big brand names like iPhone and Samsung make phones at the high end of the market – meaning the expensive ones. So once people have bought a handset, they hang on to it! If you <strong>hang onto something</strong>, you keep it. I've been hanging onto my phone for a couple of years – and am hoping I won't need to change it for another year or so, at least.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>But what happens is, if people aren't replacing their phones, the phone manufacturers don't make a big enough profit. So they start charging more…</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>… and this, in turn, makes people hang onto their phones even longer! So that's why Andrew Orlowski calls it a <strong>cycle</strong> – that's where one event leads to another, and then often repeats itself.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>So where will the cycle end?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Good question! Let's listen to Andrew again, talking about where he thinks the smartphone market is heading.</p><p><strong>Andrew Orlowski, The Register<br/></strong>I think it's a very mature market now. And you have to compare, say, a £900 Galaxy Note or a £1000 iPhone with a spectacular TV you can… a 49 inch TV you can get for £450. It no longer has that kind of must-have lustre that it might have had 4 or 5 years ago.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>What does 'mature' mean, Rob?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong><strong>Mature</strong> means fully-grown – we're mature adults for example, Catherine! And in a business context, a mature market is where supply is equal to demand.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And if something has 'must-have lustre'? What's that?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>A <strong>must-have</strong> item is something you feel you must have. And <strong>lustre</strong> means shine.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>I love shiny new things, especially when it's a piece of new tech. But £1000 is a lot of money for a phone. A spectacular 49-inch TV for only £450 sounds like a bargain though! My TV only has a 30-inch screen.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Stop there, Catherine! It's time for the answer to today's question.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>OK: Which age group have been buying smartphones at the fastest rate over the last five years here in the UK? Is it… a) 15-35 year olds, b) 35-55 year olds, or c) 55-75 year olds?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>I said 15-35 year olds.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And you were wrong, I'm afraid, Rob! The answer is 55-75 year olds! Although research also highlighted that this age group tended to use their smartphones less than younger people.The study was based on a sample of 1,163 people questioned between May and June in 2017.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Interesting. OK, I think it's time we looked back at the words we learned today. Our first word is 'functionality' – which refers to the range of functions a computer of other electronic device can perform.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>'These two computers are similar in terms of both their price and functionality.'</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Good example Catherine. Number two – if you hang on to something, you keep it. For example, 'You should hang onto your old TV, Catherine. There's nothing wrong with a 30 inch screen!'</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Thanks for the advice, Rob. And our next word is 'cycle' – that's where one event leads to another, and then often repeats itself. For example, 'I'm in a bad cycle of going to bed late, then oversleeping in the morning.'</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>You need to sort yourself out, Catherine! You're spending too much time on social media – and all that blue-screen time makes it very hard to fall asleep. The last thing you need is a bigger TV!</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>You're probably right. OK – the adjective 'mature' means fully grown or fully developed. Here's an example of the verb form– 'My investments have matured and they're worth a lot of money now!'</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Right moving on, a 'must-have item' is something you feel you must have! For example, 'Check out the latest must-have tech bargains on our website!'</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And finally, 'lustre' – which means shine.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>For example, 'I polished my brass doorknob until it shone with a pleasing lustre.'</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>OK before Rob heads off to polish is doorknob, and I nip out to buy a new big-screen TV, please remember to check out our Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube pages.</p><p><strong>Rob/Catherine<br/></strong>Bye!</p>",Transcript,"<p><strong>functionality</strong><br/>a range of functions a computer or other electronic device can perform</p><p><strong>hang on to (something)</strong><br/>keep (something)</p><p><strong>cycle</strong><br/>a process where one event leads to another, and then often repeats itself</p><p><strong>mature</strong><br/>fully grown or fully developed</p><p><strong>must-have item</strong><br/>something you feel you must have</p><p><strong>lustre</strong><br/>shine</p>",Vocabulary

Rob and Catherine talk about going to the gym and why gym membership is becoming increasingly popular and teach you new vocabulary., 23 Nov 2017,"<p><em>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript </em></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Hello, I'm Rob. Welcome to Six Minute English, where we get together to discuss an interesting topic along with six useful items of vocabulary to wrestle with.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Yes, hello I'm Catherine. And today's topic is all about togetherness – because we're talking about going to the gym and why gym membership is becoming increasingly popular. So Rob… do you head off to your local gym after work?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>No – I hate group exercise. I prefer to go for a run on my own. It's free, and I enjoy being outdoors. How about you Catherine?</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>I really like group exercise Rob. I find it's very motivating.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>When something is <strong>motivating</strong> it makes us want to do something. So what motivates you to go to the gym, Catherine?</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Well I go because I really like the spin classes.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Is that where you cycle on the spot while an instructor shouts at you?</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Well, yes that's the one! If I wasn't in a class, I don't think I would push myself so hard. I need someone to shout at me – to make me go faster and get up those hills.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Good and if you <strong>push yourself</strong> you force yourself to try harder – you set yourself a challenge. OK, Catherine – well you are part of a growing trend of people who like to <strong>work out</strong> – or exercise in a gym. So perhaps you can tell me, how many people are members of a gym, here in the UK? Is it…<br/>a) 1 in 2,<br/>b) 1 in 7 or<br/>c) 1 in 10?</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>I'm going to go for 1 in 10.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well – we'll find out if you chose the right answer later on. Now let's listen to Philip Mills – he runs the sports fitness company Les Mills – named after his father, who was a track and field athlete who represented New Zealand for twenty years. Philip has a theory to explain why group exercise has become so popular in recent years.</p><p><strong>Philip Mills, CEO of Les Mills International<br/></strong>As people have become more sedentary they've realised that they need to move for their health. We work about 35% more hours than we used to work in the 60s. And people are too busy to play sports. Society has become fragmented and a lot of the things that used to bring people together don't exist anymore. But, you know, we're tribal animals – pack animals – and the gym has been one of the things that helps people to commune.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Yes our sedentary lifestyles! We do all spend too much time sitting down, don't we, Rob?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes, and according to Philip we're probably spending more time sitting down than we used to because we're working a lot more.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And because we're busier with work, we have less time to take exercise.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>So why are we choosing to go to the gym these days, rather than heading down to the park to play football? Philip Mills thinks it's because society has become fragmented – and we're losing the social connectedness that made it easy to get together and take exercise.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And <strong>fragmented</strong> means broken up into small pieces, by the way. The thing is, we miss that social connectedness – that feeling of belonging to a group – because we are essentially tribal animals. And a <strong>tribe</strong> is a group of people who live together and they share the same language and the same culture.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>So even now most of us have left tribal society behind, we still want to feel like we're part of a group that we can commune with – which means to get close to someone or something.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>But the question is Rob, does group exercise at the gym actually succeed in connecting us with other people?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well, Philip Mills thinks in the future we'll be cycling inside a video game using computer graphics – you know, visiting other planets, travelling to different times…</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Wow! But people will then be communing with a computer Rob, not really with each other?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>I'm afraid so. And you won't even have a real instructor barking instructions at you!</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Well I suppose a computer will have a virtual instructor who will also be equally motivating!</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes, I expect so. Now, remember I asked you, Catherine: How many people are members of a gym, here in the UK?</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>I do remember you asking me that Rob and I said 1 in 10.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And you were wrong, I'm afraid! Figures collected by Leisure Data Base, a company that has audited the fitness industry for fifteen years, show that one in seven of the UK population is a member of a gym. And more and more will be signing up. Total membership could soon exceed ten million for the first time.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Wow!</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>OK, now let's talk through the vocabulary items we heard today. Number one is 'motivating' – meaning something that makes us want to do something – 'I don't find the idea of cycling in a small room very motivating.'</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Now number two – If you push yourself, you force yourself to try harder – 'It's important to push yourself if you want to do well in your exams.'</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Good advice there, Catherine. Next up is 'work out' – which means to exercise in order to improve your health and fitness. For example, 'Catherine works out three times a week by cycling on the spot.' Our fourth word is 'fragmented' or broken up into small pieces. For example, 'I suffer from fragmented sleep. I wake up five or six times a night.'</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Poor you! Alright, number four is 'tribal' – and the noun is 'tribe' – a group of people who live together and share the same language and culture.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>'Football fans often wear the tribal colours of the team they support – some paint their faces too.'</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And finally we heard 'commune', which means to get close to someone or something. For example, Rob likes to commune with nature when he goes running. He enjoys the way the landscape changes with the seasons.'</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well said, Catherine. Now, that's all we have time for today. But if you would like to commune with us via our Facebook, Twitter or YouTube pages, please do so.</p><p><strong>Catherine/Rob<br/></strong>Bye!</p>",Transcript,<p><strong>motivating</strong><br/>something that makes us want to do something</p><p><strong>push yourself</strong><br/>force yourself to try harder</p><p><strong>work out</strong><br/>to exercise in order to improve your health and fitness</p><p><strong>fragmented</strong><br/>broken up into small pieces</p><p><strong>tribal</strong><br/>something that belongs to a group of people who live together and share the same language and culture</p><p><strong>commune</strong><br/>to get close to someone or something</p>,Vocabulary

Rob and Catherine discuss this over a coffee and teach you new vocabulary., 16 Nov 2017,"<p><em>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript </em></p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Hello, I'm Catherine. Welcome to Six Minute English where we engage in some lively debate and discuss six stimulating items of vocabulary! And let's start. Here's your cup of coffee, Rob.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Thanks! But what took you so long, Catherine?</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Sorry Rob. I bumped into somebody I knew in the café and stopped for a chat.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>OK, well, that fits well with today's show where we're talking about cafés or coffee houses. Did you know, Catherine, that coffee houses were originally a meeting place for lively debate and intellectual discussion?</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Really. I didn't know that, Rob. A <strong>debate</strong>, by the way, means a discussion that a lot of people take part in. So how long ago was this debating society?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>The first coffee house was set up in Oxford in 1650. But they quickly became popular and soon they were all over London too. You paid a penny to get in, and this included access to newspapers – and stimulating conversation!</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>If something is <strong>stimulating</strong> it encourages ideas and enthusiasm. I expect the coffee helped with that a bit did it?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>It certainly helps me first thing in the morning.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Which brings me on to today's question, Rob! How many cups of coffee do we consume in coffee shops or stores in the UK every year? <strong>Consume</strong>, by the way, is another word for eat or drink. Is it…<br/>a) 2.3 million<br/>b) 23 million or<br/>c) 23 billion?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Oh I don't know but it's got to be a lot so I'm going to go for c) 23 billion? That sounds like a lot of coffee, but I buy several cups a week – and I expect you do too, Catherine?</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>I do indeed. But I have to say, while I was getting our coffees earlier, there was nobody else in the café talking except me and my friend. Everybody was sitting on their own, tapping away on their laptops. Let's listen now to Douglas Fraser, BBC Scotland's Business and Economy Editor, describing the <strong>vibe</strong> – or atmosphere – in a typical 21st century café…</p><p><strong>Douglas Fraser, BBC Scotland's Business and Economy Editor<br/></strong>Ten or so in the morning, the café has five people at tables with their backs to the wall, each staring into a screen, plugged in, ears plugged. The flow of bytes through this coffee shop's free wifi is transporting these customers to diverse destinations far from the person beside them. Collaborative working, a research grant application, a potential blockbuster novel, and inevitably, someone distracted by kitten pictures on social media.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>So the spirit of those 17th century coffee houses has disappeared then? No more lively debate and intellectual discussion?</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>It seems so Rob. As Douglas Fraser says, many people sit alone plugged into their laptops – and they're all doing different things – working, writing, messing about on social media.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>I think the café owners should turn off the free wifi and force these café squatters to move on! I don't think people should be allowed to sit all day using the internet – hogging tables – and not talking to anybody! Especially when some of them don't even buy a coffee!</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>That's a bit extreme, Rob. Café owners need customers – and they encourage people to stay by having comfy sofas and newspapers to read and the free wifi! A <strong>squatter</strong>, by the way, is someone who lives in an empty building without paying rent. And if you <strong>hog</strong> something you use most or all of it in a selfish way.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>I suppose you're right. Now, how about telling us the answer to today's question then?</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>I asked: How many cups of coffee do we consume in cafés or stores in the UK every year? Is it… a) 2.3 million b) 23 million or c) 23 billion?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>I could sit in a cafe and use their free wifi to research the answer but I had a guess and said 23 billion.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Well you didn't need that free wifi Rob because you were absolutely right! 23 billion coffees per year works out on average as 45 cups per adult in the UK.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>OK, I think it's time we looked back at the words we learned today. Our first word is 'debate' – a discussion that a lot of people take part in.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>For example, 'I took part in a number of stimulating debates at school.' Number two – if something is 'stimulating', it encourages new ideas and enthusiasm.

For example, 'My car consumes a lot of petrol.'</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Or, 'How do I calculate my car's fuel consumption?'

For example, 'Oxford is a city but it has a small-town vibe.'</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>I'm getting bad vibes from our next word – which is 'squatter' – that's someone who lives in an empty building without paying rent. The building is called a 'squat' so for example, 'I lived in a squat for two years.'</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Really?

Is it:</p><p>a) 4.6 miles per hour,</p><p>b) 14.6 miles per hour or</p><p>c) 46 miles per hour?<br/><br/>Listen to the programme to find out the answer.</p>",This week's question ,Norwich was the first city in the UK to ban cars from parts of the city centre. Planners wanted to protect pedestrians from cars and to reduce pollution in its old and narrow streets. That was 50 years ago. There’s a fresh interest in keeping cars out of cities now for the same reasons. Rob and Neil talk about pedestrianising streets and teach you new vocabulary., 02 Nov 2017,"<p><em>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript <br/></em></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Hello, I'm Rob, and welcome to 6 Minute English, where today we’re chatting about a pedestrian topic and six items of related vocabulary.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>Hello, I’m Neil. A <strong>pedestrian</strong> is someone who walks around rather than travelling by car or bus. But in Rob’s sentence he used the adjective, and in this context it means dull or uninteresting!<strong><span><span><span><br/></span></span></span></strong></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>And of course I was making a pun, Neil. Because of course the show is going to be extremely interesting! It’sabout safety on the streets – and whether pedestrianisation is a good thing or not. <strong><span><span><span><br/></span></span></span></strong></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span><strong>Pedestrianisation</strong> means changing a street into an area that can only be used by pedestrians. <span><br/></span></span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Well, it sounds like a good idea – no traffic, less noise and air pollution. And no chance of getting knocked down by a car or a bus! <span><br/></span></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>There are plans to pedestrianise Oxford Street, which is one of the busiest shopping streets in London. <span><br/></span></span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>That’s right. The Mayor of London wants to<strong> tackle </strong>– or make an effort to deal with – air pollution in this very busy spot – where the amount of traffic is definitely a problem! In fact, can you tell me, Neil, what’s the average speed of a bus travelling along Oxford Street? Is it:<br/>a) 4.6 miles per hour,<br/>b) 14.6 miles per hour or<br/>c) 46 miles per hour?<strong><span><span><span><span><span><span><br/></span></span></span></span></span></span></strong></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And I think it’s 14.6 miles per hour – a) sounds too slow and c) sounds too fast! <span><br/></span></span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>OK, we'll find out the answer later on. The problem is – the traffic doesn’t just disappear. You ban it from one area – and it gets rerouted somewhere else.<span><br/></span></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span>Ban</strong> means to say officially that something can’t be done. And <strong>reroute</strong> means to change the direction you’re travelling in, in order to reach a particular destination. That’s true, Rob. It must be a big headache for city planners.<strong><span><span> <span><br/></span></span></span></strong></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Well, let’s listen now to Joe Urvin, Chief Executive of Living Streets. He’s going to talk some more about why traffic is causing problems in our towns and cities.<span><br/></span></span></p><p><strong><span>INSERT<br/><strong><span>Joe Urvin, Chief Executive of Living Streets<br/></span></strong></span></strong><span>In 1970 we had 20 million cars in this country. Now we have over 30 million cars in such a short period. So that creates three big problems. One is space – because we’ve still got the same street structures in our towns and cities, causing congestion. It causes pollution, which people are concerned about more and more. And actually, it’s kind of engineering walking out of our lives. So we’re actually not getting enough exercise, which is a cause of a health crisis. Smart cities are looking at pedestrianisation – in Glasgow, in Birmingham, in London for example, Manchester – as a way of not only making their places, cities better and more attractive, actually, building their local economy.<span><br/></span></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>So Neil Urvin identifies three problems – the first is that our city streets have stayed the same while the number of cars on the roads has increased dramatically. <span><br/></span></span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<span><br/></span></span></strong>That’s right – and this has led to congestion on our roads. <strong>Congestion</strong> means too much traffic, making it hard to move.<strong><span><span><span><span><br/></span></span></span></span></strong></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>The second problem is pollution – which we mentioned earlier.<span><br/></span></span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span><span> Pollution</span></strong><span> is damage to the environment caused by releasing waste substances such as carbon dioxide into the air.<span><br/></span></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span><span>And the third problem is that by travelling around on buses or in our cars we aren’t getting enough exercise. And we all know that’s a bad thing! Would pedestrianisation engineer walking back into our lives do you think?<span><br/></span></span></span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span><span>I’m not sure, Neil. It would be great if we could go shopping or walk to work without breathing in fumes or worrying about getting knocked down by a car. But banning all motorised traffic from town centres might make life difficult for people to get around.<span><br/></span></span></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<span><br/></span></span></strong><span>Well, I’m not a town planner – and I don’t have the answers. But I would like to know if I got the answer right to the question you asked me earlier!<span><br/></span></span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<span><br/></span></span></strong><span>OK, well I asked you: What’s the average speed of a bus travelling along Oxford Street? Is it… a) 4.6mph, b) 14.6mph or c) 46mph?<span><br/></span></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span><span>And I said 14.6mph.<span><br/></span></span></span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<span><br/></span></span></strong><span>And that’s not slow enough, Neil, I’m afraid. The answer is actually 4.6mph. And we pedestrians walk at an average speed of 3.1mph apparently!<span><br/></span></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<span><br/></span></span></strong><span>Good to know. OK – shall we go over the words we learned today, Rob?<span><br/></span></span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Sure – the first one is ‘pedestrian’ – a person who is walking, usually in an area where there’s traffic. ‘Sorry – you can’t ride your bike here. This path is for pedestrians only.’<span><br/></span></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil</span></strong><br/>The adjective – ‘This book is full of very pedestrian ideas. I wouldn’t read it if I were you.’ <strong><span><span><span><br/></span></span></span></strong></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>I’ve crossed it off my list, Neil. Thank you. OK – number two is 'to tackle' something, which means to make an effort to deal with a difficult problem. For example, ‘The government isn’t really tackling the problem of air pollution. It needs to do much more.’<span><br/></span></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Very true. OK, ‘ban’ means to officially say that something can’t be done. ‘The UK government will ban the sale of diesel and petrol cars from 2040.’ <span><br/></span></span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>And number four is ‘reroute’ which means to change the direction you’re travelling in.<strong><span><span><span><br/></span></span></span></strong></p><p><strong><span>Neil</span></strong><br/>‘The council has rerouted all buses to avoid the town centre.’ <strong><span><span><span><br/></span></span></span></strong></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>‘Congestion’ is number five – too much traffic, making it difficult to move.<span><br/></span></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>‘Road congestion always gets better in the summer when a lot of car drivers are on holiday.’<span><br/></span></span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>That’s true, isn’t it? London always seems emptier in July and August.<span><br/></span></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Except for all the tourists walking around – congesting the streets!<span><br/></span></span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Very funny! And finally, number six is ‘pollution’ – which is damage to the environment caused by releasing waste substances such as carbon dioxide into the air, or plastic into the sea.<span><br/></span></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil</span></strong><br/>‘You can help reduce air pollution by walking to work every day instead of driving.’<strong><span><span><span><br/></span></span></span></strong></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Are you talking to me, Neil? I always walk to work!<span><br/></span></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span><span>I know you do, Rob – you’re an example to us all! <span><br/></span></span></span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>OK, that’s all we have time for today. <span><br/></span></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>But please don’t forget to visit us via our Twitter, Facebook and YouTube pages!

Neil and Rob talk about sugar and teach you some tempting new vocabulary., 26 Oct 2017,"<p><em>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript <span><br/></span></em></p><p><strong><span>Rob<span><br/></span></span></strong><span>I’m Rob. Welcome to 6 Minute English – we’ve got a sweet topic today, and six tempting items of vocabulary. <span><br/></span></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<span><br/></span></span></strong><span>Hello, I’m Neil. And we’re going to be talking about sugar – which many of us find tempting. But how much is too much, Rob? <span><br/></span></span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>I don’t know, Neil, but hopefully we’ll be finding that out. I must admit though – I <strong>have a sweet tooth</strong> – and that means I like sugary things!<strong><span><span><span><br/></span></span></span></strong></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Me too. But something I’m always seeing in the news these days is that we’re eating too much sugar. And one important factor is that sugars are sometimes hidden in processed foods.</p><p><strong><span data-mce-mark=""1"">Rob<br/></span></strong><span data-mce-mark=""1""><strong>Processed</strong> food is any food that has been changed in some way – by freezing it or putting it in tins – or by combining foods or adding chemicals. In fact, some of the sugars we eat are hidden in food that we think of as healthy. Such as yoghurts, low fat snacks, and fruit drinks.<span data-mce-mark=""1""><br/></span></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Do you check the information on the back of food packets, Rob? – To see what’s in them?<span><br/></span></span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, I do. But it can be very confusing – there’s so much information. And I’m not always sure how much of a certain thing is bad.<span><br/></span></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, that brings me onto today’s quiz question. Can you tell me, if a food contains 5% total sugars per 100g, is it…<br/><span>a) high in sugar,<br/><span><span>b) low in sugar or<br/><span>c) somewhere in the middle?<span><br/></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>I’ll say low, Neil.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>OK. Well, we'll find out later. Some food products have colour coding on the packaging to help you understand the information, don’t they? – red for high levels of sugar, salt or fat– orange for medium, and green for low.<span><br/></span></span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>That sounds helpful. Then you can see <strong>at a glance</strong> what’s good or bad for you. <span><br/></span></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span>At a glance</strong> means with a quick look. OK, let’s listen now to BBC reporter Rajeev Gupta interviewing a man in Chester, in the UK. He’s asking him to guess how much sugar there is in a pot of fat-free yoghurt.</p><p><span><span><span><strong><span>INSERT<br/>Rajeev Gupta, reporter interviewing a man in Chester</span></strong><br/><span> </span><span><strong>Reporter:</strong> I've actually got a pot of yoghurt in front of me. This says 'fat-free' on it and it's been marketed as being quite healthy. If I was to say how much sugar is in here, what would you say as… say is the quantity of the tub?<br/><span><strong>Interviewee:</strong> I’d probably think maybe a couple of teaspoonfuls, you know, it’s quite surprising how much is sugars in all these products, isn’t there?<br/><span><strong>Reporter:</strong> Well, there’s about a third of this yoghurt pot is actually sugar.<br/><span><strong>Interviewee: </strong>To be honest, that’s quite amazing, that. I would never have thought a third of that would have been sugar just by looking at it. And it does say it’s fat-free.<span><br/></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>So the yoghurt is <strong>fat-free</strong>, which means it doesn’t contain any fat. And the man guessed there might be two teaspoons of sugar in the yoghurt.</p><p><span><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span><span>That’s right. And if something is sugar-free then it doesn’t contain any sugar. But in this case, a third of the yoghurt’s content was sugar. That, to me, sounds like an awful lot – even for someone with a sweet tooth like me!<span><br/></span></span></span></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>OK, well, let’s listen to Dr Gunter Kuhnle. He’s a Nutritional Biochemist at Reading University.<span><br/></span></span></p><p><strong><span>INSERT<br/><strong><span>Dr Gunter Kuhnle, nutritional biochemist at Reading University, UK </span></strong><br/></span></strong><span> One problem we see – nutritionists – is sort of this focusing on any individual foods – at one time it was that fat has to be avoided at all costs, now it seems to go towards sugar and sugar is demonised and people link it to drugs and so on. I think this is the wrong way forward. Individuals, yes, you should have a balanced diet. It is important also to enjoy your food and not do this extreme focusing on one side or one aspect and individual nutrients.<span><strong><span><span><br/></span></span></strong></span></span></p><p><span><strong>Rob</strong><br/>So if you <strong>avoid something at all costs</strong></span><span> you do everything you can to avoid it. And </span><strong><span>demonise</span></strong><span> means to make someone or something seem very bad.<span><br/></span></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<span><br/></span></span></strong><span>Dr Kuhnle thinks that totally cutting out one type of food like this – whether it’s fat or sugar – is wrong. He thinks we should eat a balanced diet – and enjoy our food.<span><br/></span></span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<span><br/></span></span></strong><span>That sounds very sensible. Now, how about telling us the answer to today’s quiz question, Neil?<span><br/></span></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<span><br/></span></span></strong><span>Thanks for reminding me, Rob. I asked: if food contains 5% total sugars per 100g, is it… a) high in sugar, b) low in sugar or c) somewhere in the middle? You said low… and you were… right! Well done!<span><br/></span></span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<span><br/></span></span></strong><span>Thank you.<span><br/></span></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<span><br/></span></span></strong><span>If foods contain more than 22.5% total sugars per 100g they are classified as high. <span><br/></span></span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<span><br/></span></span></strong><span>And I guess that between 5 and 22.5% they are somewhere in the middle.<span><br/></span></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<span><br/></span></span></strong><span>Correct! OK, shall we go over the words we heard today?<span><br/></span></span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<span><br/></span></span></strong><span>Yep. First up – if you have a ‘sweet tooth’ it means you like sugary things. For example, ‘My little nephew has a sweet tooth. He eats far too many biscuits and sweets.’<span><br/></span></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span><span> </span></strong><span>His dentist won’t be pleased! Number two – ‘processed food’ is any food that has been changed in some way – by freezing it or putting it in tins – or by combining foods or adding chemicals.<span><br/></span></span></p><p><strong><span>Rob</span></strong><span><br/><span>For example, ‘The meat in sausages is highly processed.’<span><br/></span></span></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<span><br/></span></span></strong><span>Oh dear, I didn’t know that. I’m a big fan of sausages!<span><br/></span></span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<span><br/></span></span></strong><span>Number three – ‘at a glance’ – means with a quick look.<span><br/></span></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<span><br/></span></span></strong><span>For example, 'I could tell at a glance that I wouldn’t like the food at that restaurant.’<span><br/></span></span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<span><br/></span></span></strong><span>‘Fat-free’ means without any fat in it. For example, ‘I bought this yoghurt because it says fat-free on the label.’<span><br/></span></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<span><br/></span></span></strong>Aha – but did you realise that a third of it was sugar! Moving on – If you avoid something‘at all costs’ you do everything you can to avoid it. For example, ‘I wanted to win the game at all costs.’<strong><span><span><span><span><br/></span></span></span></span></strong></p><p><strong><span>Rob<span><br/></span></span></strong><span>I didn’t know you were so competitive, Neil! And finally – ‘demonise’ – means to make someone or something seem very bad.<span><br/></span></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<span><br/></span></span></strong><span>‘Politicians shouldn’t demonise their opponents.’<span><br/></span></span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<span><br/></span></span></strong><span>They often do though, don’t they?

What’s that, Rob?<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>I have no idea!<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, you won’t find wetiquette in many dictionaries – it actually means ‘swimming pool etiquette’. W-etiquette – get it? Etiquette is a set of rules for how to behave in social situations. And wetiquette is a set of dos and don’ts to keep things calm in the water.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Rob<span><br/></span>Dos and don’ts</strong> are also rules telling us how to behave. So things like ‘No running by the pool’ or ‘No diving in the shallow end’. Am I right?<strong><span><span><br/></span></span></strong></p><p><strong>Neil<span><br/></span></strong>Yes and no, Rob. Those are traditional swimming pool rules. But wetiquette covers slightly different things.<strong><span><span><br/></span></span></strong></p><p><strong>Rob<span><br/></span></strong>OK, well before we get to those, I have a question for you, Neil. According to the US Water Quality and Health Council, how many people admitted to not showering before using the pool? Is it…<br/>a) 7%,<br/>b) 17% or<br/>c) 70%.<strong><span><span><br/></span></span></strong></p><p><strong>Neil<span><br/></span></strong>Well, I’m going to be optimistic and say 7%, Rob.<strong><span><span><br/></span></span></strong></p><p><strong>Rob</strong><span><br/>So I take it you do always take a shower before swimming, Neil?<span><br/></span></span></p><p><strong>Neil<span><br/></span></strong>Correct. Taking a quick shower is such an easy thing to do, and it stops all that horrible sweat and bacteria getting in the pool water! I can’t understand why some people don’t do it!<strong><span><span><br/></span></span></strong></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>I can see it’s making you quite <strong>hot under the collar </strong>- and that means angry. Let’s listen to swimming specialist, Jenny Landreth, talking about what annoys her.<strong><br/><br/><strong>INSERT<br/></strong>Jenny Landreth, swimming specialist, interviewed by the BBC</strong><br/><strong>Jenny Landreth:</strong> I'm very keen on my wetiquette in the pool.<br/><strong>Interviewer:</strong> It's that thing where people can get quite cross about, which is: Do you go around clockwise or anticlockwise? Do you overtake or not?<br/><strong>Jenny Landreth:</strong> People need a rule. We need to observe the rules of the pool and I'm very keen on that. Most other swimmers will suffer from lane rage if people are in the wrong lane of the pool. And don’t know how to observe the rules of that lane.<br/><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Lane rage – you mean if you’re a kind of slow swimmer and you dare to go in the fast lane?<br/><strong>Jenny Landreth:</strong> Well, I hate to say it, but it is quite often that gentlemen quite often misjudge their speed and think they’re slightly faster than they are.<br/><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Ah! The male ego here!<br/><strong>Jenny Landreth:</strong> They quite often don’t like it if there’s a woman swimming faster than them. So very often they’ll go in the slightly faster lane and should be gently encouraged by wetiquette to get in the correct lane.<br/><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Know your speed.<br/><strong>Jenny Landreth:</strong> Yes.</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/> That was Jenny Landreth – a swimming specialist – talking about the things that annoy her about other people in the pool.<span data-mce-mark=""1""><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/> Yes. Jenny doesn't like it when people are slower that they should be for the fast lane. Older men, like you, Rob.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/> Neil, how dare you! Yes, Jenny gets 'lane rage'.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<span><br/></span></strong>Lane rage! Where swimmers get hot under the collar when there’s a slow swimmer in the fast lane.<strong><span><span><br/></span></span></strong></p><p><strong>Rob<span><br/></span></strong>Swimming <strong>lanes</strong> are the vertical sections of a swimming pool that are often labelled as ‘fast’, ‘medium’, and ‘slow’. Do you know your speed, Neil?<strong><span><span><br/></span></span></strong></p><p><strong>Neil<span><br/></span></strong>Yes – I’m fast.<strong><span><span><br/></span></span></strong></p><p><strong>Rob<span><br/></span></strong>Are you sure you are not misjudging your speed? Do you think you might actually be a medium-fast swimmer?<strong><span><span><br/></span></span></strong></p><p><strong>Neil<span><br/></span></strong>To <strong>misjudge</strong> means to guess something wrongly. And our <strong>ego</strong> is the idea we have of ourselves – with regards to how important we feel we are. And to answer your question, Rob, no, I’m definitely fast.<strong><span><span><br/></span></span></strong></p><p><strong>Rob <span><br/></span></strong>Are there other things swimmers should be aware of in the pool?<strong><span><span><br/></span></span></strong></p><p><strong>Neil<span><br/></span></strong>Yes – if somebody taps your foot, it means they want to overtake you.<strong><span><span><br/></span></span></strong></p><p><strong>Rob<span><br/></span>Overtaking </strong>means to pass another person travelling in the same direction because you are going faster than them.<strong><span><span><br/></span></span></strong></p><p><strong>Neil<span><br/></span></strong>I hate it when swimmers overtake me!<strong><span><span><br/></span></span></strong></p><p><strong>Rob<span><br/></span></strong>Really, Neil? Is that your male ego talking?<strong><span><span><br/></span></span></strong></p><p><strong>Neil<span><br/></span></strong>No, not at all – I just hate getting splashed.<strong><span><span><br/></span></span></strong></p><p><strong>Rob<span><br/></span></strong>I see. Well perhaps now is a good time to move on and hear the answer to today’s quiz question. Remember I asked: How many people admitted to not showering before using the pool? Is it… a) 7%, b) 17% or c) 70%?<strong><span><span><br/></span></span></strong></p><p><strong>Neil<span><br/></span></strong>I said 7% and I hope I’m right.<strong><span><span><br/></span></span></strong></p><p><strong>Rob<span><br/></span></strong>Well, I’m afraid you’re wrong, Neil. It’s actually ten times that amount – it’s 70%! The 2012 US report from Water Quality and Health Council found that around 70% of people do not shower before taking a swim in the pool – adding to the number of germs in the water.<strong><span><span><br/></span></span></strong></p><p><strong>Neil<span><br/></span></strong>Perhaps swimming pools should start fining people who don’t take a shower? That might make a difference. Now, let’s go over the words we learned today.<strong><span><span><br/></span></span></strong></p><p><strong>Rob<span><br/></span></strong>Yes, the first one is ‘dos and don’ts’, which are rules telling us how to behave in a particular situation. For example, “What are the dos and don’ts of meeting the Queen?”<strong><span><span><br/></span></span></strong></p><p><strong>Neil<span><br/></span></strong>Good question – Is the correct etiquette to call her Your Highness or Ma’am? Are there certain subjects you shouldn’t talk about?<strong><span><span><br/></span></span></strong></p><p><strong>Rob<span><br/></span></strong>Do you shake her hand or curtsy?<strong><span><span><br/></span></span></strong></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>These are things you need to know – or else the Queen might get ‘hot under collar’ – that’s our next word, and it means angry!<strong><span><span><br/></span></span></strong></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>“Both politicians got hot under the collar and insulted each other.”<strong><span><br/></span></strong></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>OK – number three is ‘lanes’ – which are the vertical sections of a swimming pool that are often labelled as ‘fast’, ‘medium’, and ‘slow’.<strong><span><br/></span></strong></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>“Our British Olympic gold medallist is swimming in lane one.”<strong><span><br/></span></strong></p><p><strong>Neil<span><br/></span></strong>Our next word is ‘misjudge’ which means to guess something wrongly. For example, “I’m sorry I misjudged you, Rob. Please forgive me.”<strong><span><span><br/></span></span></strong></p><p><strong>Rob<span><br/></span></strong>Oh alright then, Neil. But don’t misjudge me again OK? Next up is ‘ego’ – which is our sense of how important we are.<strong><span><span><br/></span></span></strong></p><p><strong>Neil<span><br/></span></strong>“Losing the race was a huge blow to her ego.”<strong><span><span><br/></span></span></strong></p><p><strong>Rob<span><br/></span></strong>And our final word is ‘overtake’ – which means to pass another person travelling in the same direction because you are going faster than them.<strong><span><span><br/></span></span></strong></p><p><strong>Neil<span><br/></span></strong>“I don’t enjoy overtaking big lorries on the motorway.”<strong><span><span><br/></span></span></strong></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Neither do I, Neil. Now one of the don’ts of this show is not talking for more than six minutes.

Is water in a bottle really better for you. Neil and Rob quench your thirst for new vocabulary and discuss H2O., 12 Oct 2017,"<p><em>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript </em></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Welcome to 6 Minute English, where we introduce a refreshing topic and six related items of vocabulary. I'm Rob.</p><p><strong>Neil <br/></strong>And I’m Neil… And today we’re talking about water – there’s nothing more refreshing than an ice-cold bottle of water straight out of the vending machine… Ah!</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>OK.<strong><strong> Refreshing</strong> </strong>in this context means making you feel cool again after being hot. So has that cooled you down, Neil? </p><p><strong>Neil <br/></strong>Yes, I feel very refreshed now, thanks. </p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Can I ask you though – why didn’t you just get a glass of water from the kitchen tap? That water is cool and refreshing too – and it’s free! </p><p><strong>Neil <br/></strong>Well, I like this brand of bottled water better – it’s enriched with salts and minerals that are very beneficial to your health. <strong>Enriched</strong> means improving the quality of something by adding to it. </p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Enriched!! Honestly, Neil!<strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>It tastes better, Rob.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yeah…</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I’m not the only one who thinks so. For the first time in the UK, bottled water is more popular than cola. In fact, can you tell me how many litres of bottled water were sold in the UK in 2016? Was it…<br/>a) 2.9 billion litres,<br/>b) 29 million litres or<br/>c) 2.9 million litres?<strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Right. Well, I’m going to say 29 million litres.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>OK. We’ll find out later if you got that right or wrong. But seriously, Rob, don’t you think it’s a good thing that people are choosing to buy bottled water at the supermarket rather than fizzy drinks?</p><p><strong>Rob <br/></strong>Yes, of course. But as I said to you earlier, why don’t people just drink tap water? Let’s listen to Natalie Fee, founder of City to Sea, which campaigns against plastic pollution – and of course, bottled water causes a huge amount of that. Here’s Natalie now, talking about how drinks manufacturers have persuaded people that bottled water is better for them.</p><p><strong>INSERT<br/><strong>Natalie Fee, founder of City to Sea<br/></strong></strong>They manufactured the demand for bottled water and they spent millions of pounds on adverts sort of scaring us off of tap water. The bottled water companies set out to make us believe that tap water wasn’t healthy. And yet, tap water is way more regulated than bottled water is, and in taste tests, tap water comes up trumps most times.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>If you <strong>manufacture</strong> something you make it in large amounts in a factory. But here Natalie says the drinks companies <em>‘manufactured the demand </em>for bottled water’…</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Which means they made adverts to persuade people that tap water wasn’t healthy – and bottled water was.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Hmm – To scare people off – What does that mean, Rob?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well, if you <strong>scare somebody off </strong>you make them go away by frightening them. So some advertisers may have suggested, for example, that tap water was unsafe to drink …<strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Whereas bottled water was safer, and tasted better too!</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>You’re catching on! However, Natalie Fee claims that tap water is more regulated than bottled water is. </p><p><strong>Neil<br/>Regulated</strong> means controlled. Natalie also says that in taste tests tap water comes up trumps. What does she mean by that?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well, a taste test is where you ask people to try several very similar products without knowing which one is which, and then you grade them according to which you like the best. And if something <strong>comes up trumps </strong>– it means it produces a good result, often unexpectedly.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So tap water comes up trumps, eh?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yup. Perhaps you should try a taste test now, Neil? It would be interesting to see if your enriched bottled water comes up trumps of not!</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I tell you what, let’s leave that until later and hear the answer to today’s quiz question instead.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>OK.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I asked you: How many litres of bottled water were sold in the UK in 2016? Was it… a) 2.9 billion litres, b) 29 million litres or c) 2.9 million litres?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yeah. And I said 29 million litres.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And the answer is… 2.9 billion litres.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Wow!</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>You can buy many different brands of bottled water with a range of price tags. At the top end, there’s water from a 4,000 year-old Norwegian iceberg.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>How much does that cost?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Around £80 a bottle.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>As cheap as that? I’ll pop out and get some later. OK let’s review the words we learned today. The first one was ‘refreshing’, which means making you feel cool again after being hot.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>“I enjoyed a refreshing cup of tea.”</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>We British like to say that, don’t we? Though I don’t understand how a hot drink can be refreshing. OK – number two – ‘enriched’, which means improving the quality of something by adding to it. For example, “Did you know that many types of breakfast cereal are enriched with vitamins and minerals, Neil?”</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>No, I didn’t, Rob. You learn something new every day. Number three is ‘manufacture’ – to make something in large amounts in a factory. “This company manufactures wellington boots.”</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>“I am a wellington boot manufacturer.” That has a nice ring to it. Anyway, when you scare someone off you make them go away by frightening them. “The dog barked fiercely and scared off the two burglars.”</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Down, Rob, down! Number five – ‘regulated’ – or controlled – for example, “The sale of tobacco is tightly regulated by the government.”</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And finally – if something ‘comes up trumps’ it produces a good result, often unexpectedly. </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>“My lottery ticket came up trumps again! I can’t believe it!”</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>You’re a lucky man, Neil. OK – it’s time to do that taste test now. If you have an opinion on bottled water or anything else, please tell us about it on our Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, or YouTube pages.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>OK. This one definitely tastes better.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And how about this one?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yeah, definitely. </p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>That’s the tap water, Neil.</p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>No, no, no. I refuse to believe it!</span></p>",Transcript,"<p><strong>refreshing<br/></strong>making you feel cool again after being hot<br/><span><strong><br/>enriched<br/></strong>improving the quality of something by adding to it</span></p><p><span><strong>manufacture<br/></strong>something you make it in large amounts in a factory</span></p><p><span><strong>scare somebody off<br/></strong>make them go away by frightening them </span></p><p><span><strong>regulated<br/></strong><span>controlled </span></span></p><p><span><strong>comes up trumps<br/></strong>produces a good result, often unexpectedly </span></p>",Vocabulary

Do you know the more the better for your health. Neil and Rob talk about the need to exercise and teach you some related vocabulary., 05 Oct 2017,"<p><em>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript</em></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Hello, I’m Neil. And welcome to 6 Minute English, where we vigorously discuss a new topic and six related items of vocabulary. </p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And hello, I’m Rob. Today we’re discussing vigorous exercise – and whether adults take enough of it! <strong>Vigorous</strong> means using a lot of energy to do something. </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So how many steps do you do in a day, Rob? </p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>How many steps? How should I know, Neil? – It would be pretty hard to count them all. </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Oh, come on! You can track steps on your phone! I do ten thousand a day – which is the magic number for keeping fit and healthy, apparently. </p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Not if you saunter, Neil, surely? Sauntering from the sofa to the fridge and back – Or from the house to the car. </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well I never saunter, Rob. <strong>Saunter</strong> means to walk slowly. And you’d have to make a lot of trips to the fridge to clock up ten thousand steps. To get some vigorous exercise, you need to get out and about – round the park at a brisk pace…<strong style=""font-size: 12px;""> </strong></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong><strong style=""font-size: 12px;"">Brisk</strong> means quick and energetic – the opposite of sauntering. OK, well, perhaps you can you tell me, Neil, how many people aged between 40 and 60 do less than ten minutes brisk walking every month? Is it…<br/>a) 4%,<br/>b) 14% or<br/>c) 40%? </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I’m going to say… 4% because ten minutes is such a short amount of time! </p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Indeed. Now, I’ve got another question for you, Neil. Why is exercise so important? Because it sounds pretty boring – counting steps, going to the gym, running on a machine. </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, when you exercise, you stimulate the body’s natural repair system. Your body will actually stay younger if you exercise! </p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>That sounds good. </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Exercise also lowers your risk of developing illnesses such as heart disease, cancer, and diabetes. </p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Hmm. I’m getting a bit worried now, Neil. But I don’t have enough time to do a thousand steps every day… I’m far too busy! </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, Rob. Now might be a good time to listen to Julia Bradbury. She’s a TV presenter and outdoor walking enthusiast who will explain how she builds walking into her busy life. </p><p><strong>INSERT<br/>Julia Bradbury, TV presenter and outdoor walking enthusiast</strong><strong style=""font-size: 12px;""><br/></strong>I will walk to meetings instead of catching a bus, or getting a taxi or a car – into meetings. And I will also, if I can’t build that into my working day, if it’s a day when I haven’t got meetings and I’m maybe at home with the kids, I will take the time – I will take my kids out with the buggy and I will definitely do 30-40 minutes at least everyday. Going to the park, going to the shops, picking up my things up en route, and really sort of building it into my life. Taking the stairs and not taking lifts, all of these kinds of little decisions can incrementally build up to create more walking time in your day.<strong style=""font-size: 12px;""> </strong></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>So if you <strong>build something in</strong> to your day – or your life – you include it from the beginning. </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And Julia Bradbury has built walking into her day. Even though she’s very busy too, Rob! You should learn from her! </p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>So she walks instead of driving or taking the bus. And takes the stairs instead of the lift. I could do those things. </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>You could indeed – before you know it, you’d be doing ten thousand steps – because the amount of walking you do in a day builds incrementally. </p><p><strong>Rob<br/>Incrementally</strong> means gradually increasing in size. OK, well, before I think that over, perhaps I could tell you the answer to today’s quiz question? </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>OK. You asked me: How many people aged between 40 and 60 do less than ten minutes brisk walking every month? The options were:<br/>a) 4%,<br/>b) 14% or<br/>c) 40%? </p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And you said 4%. But I’m afraid it’s actually 40%. And that’s according to the Government body <em>Public Health England</em> here in the UK.<strong style=""font-size: 12px;""> </strong></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Oh dear, that’s a lot more people than I expected. But it isn’t that surprising – people in all age groups are leading more sedentary lifestyles these days. Our job is very <strong style=""font-size: 12px;"">sedentary</strong> – which means it involves a lot of sitting and not much exercise! </p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well, I might just run on the spot while we go over the new vocabulary we’ve learned today! </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Good plan. First up we heard ‘vigorous’ – which means using a lot of energy to do something. </p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>OK. “I am running vigorously on the spot!” </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Great example! And good to see you taking some vigorous exercise! Number two – ‘saunter’ – means to walk slowly in a relaxed way. “When I saw Rob, I sauntered over to say hello.”<strong style=""font-size: 12px;""> </strong></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Hi Neil. Number three – ‘brisk’ means quick and energetic. </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>“It’s important to take some brisk exercise every day.” </p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes! And I’m beginning to realise that might be true. </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yep! I think you've done enough jogging for today, Rob. You’ve probably done about a hundred steps. </p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Is that all? OK, number four – if you ‘build something in to something’ – you include it from the beginning. </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>“It’s important to build regular exercise into your daily routine.” </p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Very good advice. Number five is ‘incrementally’ which means gradually increasing in size. </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Incremental is the adjective. “The company has been making incremental changes to its pay structure.” </p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Does that mean we’re getting a pay rise? </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I doubt it! And finally, number six – ‘sedentary’ means sitting a lot and not taking much exercise. For example, “It’s bad for your health to lead such a sedentary lifestyle.” </p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Duly noted, Neil! Well, it’s time to go now. But if today’s show has inspired you to step out and take more exercise, please let us know by visiting our Twitter, Facebook and YouTube pages and telling us about it!<strong style=""font-size: 12px;""> </strong></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Goodbye! </p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Bye bye!</p>",Transcript,<p><strong>vigorous<br/></strong>using a lot of energy to do something</p><p><strong>saunter<br/></strong>walk slowly</p><p><strong>brisk<br/></strong>quick and energetic (the opposite of sauntering)</p><p><strong>build something in</strong> (to your day or your life)<br/>include it from the beginning</p><p><strong>incrementally<br/></strong>gradually increasing in size</p><p><strong>sedentary</strong> (job or life)<br/>it involves a lot of sitting and not much exercise</p>,Vocabulary

I’m Neil.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Tim<br/></strong>And I’m Tim. And today we’re talking about AI – or Artificial Intelligence.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong><strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong> is the ability of machines to copy human intelligent behaviour – for example, an intelligent machine can learn from its own mistakes, and make decisions based on what’s happened in the past.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Tim<br/></strong>There’s a lot of talk about AI these days, Neil, but it’s still just science fiction, isn’t it?<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>That’s not true – AI is everywhere. Machine thinking is in our homes, offices, schools and hospitals. Computer algorithms are helping us drive our cars. They’re diagnosing what’s wrong with us in hospitals. They’re marking student essays… They’re telling us what to read on our smartphones…<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Tim<br/></strong>Well, that really does sound like science fiction – but it’s happening already, you say, Neil?<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>It’s definitely happening, Tim. And an<strong> algorithm</strong>, by the way, is a set of steps a computer follows in order to solve a problem. So can you tell me what was the name of the computer which famously beat world chess champion Garry Kasparov using algorithms in 1997? Was it…<br/>a) Hal,<br/>b) Alpha 60 or<br/>c) Deep Blue?<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Tim<br/></strong>I’ll say Deep Blue. Although I’m just guessing.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Was it an educated guess, Tim?<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Tim<br/></strong>I know a bit about chess…<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>An educated guess is based on knowledge and experience and is therefore likely to be correct. Well, we’ll find out later on how educated your guess was in this case, Tim!<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Tim<br/></strong>Indeed. But getting back to AI and what machines can do – are they any good at solving real-life problems? Computers think in zeros and ones don’t they? That sounds like a pretty limited language when it comes to life experience!<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>You would be surprised to what those zeroes and ones can do, Tim. Although you’re right that AI does have its limitations at the moment. And if something has<strong> limitations </strong>there’s a limit on what it can do or how good it can be.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Tim<br/></strong>OK – well now might be a good time to listen to Zoubin Bharhramani, Professor of Information Engineering at the University of Cambridge and deputy director of the Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence. He’s talking about what limitations AI has at the moment.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Zoubin Bharhramani, Professor of Information Engineering at the University of Cambridge and deputy director of the Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence <br/></strong>I think it’s very interesting how many of the things that we take for granted – we humans take for granted – as being sort of things we don’t even think about like how do we walk, how do we reach, how do we recognize our mother. You know, all these things. When you start to think how to implement them on a computer, you realize that it’s those things that are incredibly difficult to get computers to do, and that’s where the current cutting edge of research is.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>If we <strong>take something for granted</strong> we don’t realise how important something is.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Tim<br/></strong>You sometimes take me for granted, I think, Neil.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>No – I never take you for granted, Tim! You’re far too important for that!<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Tim<br/></strong>Good to hear! So things we take for granted are doing every day tasks like walking, picking something up, or recognizing somebody. We <strong>implement </strong>– or perform – these things without thinking – Whereas it’s cutting edge research to try and program a machine to do them.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong><strong>Cutting edge</strong> means very new and advanced. It’s interesting isn't it, that over ten years ago a computer beat a chess grand master – but the same computer would find it incredibly difficult to pick up a chess piece.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Tim<br/></strong>I know. It’s very strange. But now you’ve reminded me that we need the answer to today’s question.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Which was: What was the name of the computer which famously beat world chess champion Garry Kasparov in 1997? Now, you said Deep Blue, Tim, and … that was the right answer!<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Tim<br/></strong>You see, my educated guess was based on knowledge and experience!<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Or maybe you were just lucky. So, the IBM supercomputer Deep Blue played against US world chess champion Garry Kasparov in two chess matches. The first match was played in Philadelphia in 1996 and was won by Kasparov. The second was played in New York City in 1997 and won by Deep Blue. The 1997 match was the first defeat of a reigning world chess champion by a computer under tournament conditions.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Tim<br/></strong>Let’s go through the words we learned today. First up was ‘artificial intelligence’ or AI – the ability of machines to copy human intelligent behaviour.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>“There are AI programs that can write poetry.”<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Tim<br/></strong>Do you have any examples you can recite?<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Afraid I don’t! Number two – an algorithm is a set of steps a computer follows in order to solve a problem. For example, “Google changes its search algorithm hundreds of times every year.”<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Tim<br/></strong>The adjective is algorithmic – for example, “Google has made many algorithmic changes.”<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Number three – if something has ‘limitations’ – there’s a limit on what it can do or how good it can be. “Our show has certain limitations – for example, it’s only six minutes long!”<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Tim<br/></strong>That’s right – there’s only time to present six vocabulary items. Short but sweet!<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And very intelligent, too. OK, the next item is ‘take something for granted’ – which is when we don’t realise how important something is.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Tim<br/></strong>“We take our smart phones for granted these days – but before 1995 hardly anyone owned one.”<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Number five – ‘to implement’ – means to perform a task, or take action.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Tim<br/></strong>“Neil implemented some changes to the show.”<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>The final item is ‘cutting edge’ – new and advanced – “This software is cutting edge.”<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Tim<br/></strong>“The software uses cutting edge technology.”<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>OK – that’s all we have time for on today’s cutting edge show. But please check out our Instagram, Twitter, Facebook and YouTube pages.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Tim<br/></strong>Bye-bye!<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Goodbye!</p>",Transcript,"<p><span><strong>artificial intelligence</strong> or <strong>AI</strong><br/>the ability of machines to copy human intelligent behaviour.</span></p><p><span><strong> an algorithm</strong><br/>a set of steps a computer follows in order to solve a problem</span></p><p><span><strong>limitations</strong><br/>a limit on what it can do or how good it can be</span></p><p><span><strong>take something for granted</strong><br/>when we don’t realise how important something is</span></p><p><span><strong>to implement</strong><br/>to perform a task, or take action</span></p><p><span><strong>cutting edge</strong><br/>new and advanced </span></p>",Vocabulary

Our hairs do rise!</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yes – Tim, they do. We get goose bumps when we’re cold, scared, or excited.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Tim<br/></span></strong><span>But other mammals do it better than us – Cats fluff up when they see other cats they don’t like.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>That’s true – We can’t fluff up because we don’t have enough body hair.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Tim<br/></span></strong><span>I suppose we used to be as hairy as gorillas – if you go back a million years or so. </span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Do you know why we lost so much hair, Tim?</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Tim<br/></span></strong><span>Isn’t it because it allowed us to sweat more easily? This meant we didn’t get so hot and tired – we could run faster and for longer – and catch more animals to eat!<br/><br/></span><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>That sounds like a good theory. But do you have a theory on how many hair follicles the human body has today? </span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Tim<br/></span></strong><span>What’s a hair follicle?</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>A <strong>hair</strong></span><span> </span><strong><span>follicle</span></strong><span> is the organ that produces a hair underneath the skin. Now answer the question, Tim. How many hair follicles does the human body have today? Is it …<br/></span><span>a) 500,000,<br/></span><span>b) 5 million or<br/></span><span>c) 50 million?</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Tim<br/></span></strong><span>50 million sounds about right. </span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Did you know that men have more than women, Tim?</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Tim<br/></span></strong><span>No, I didn’t – but it makes sense since men are usually hairier than women.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>On their faces – but not necessarily on their heads!</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Tim<br/></span></strong><span>Are you referring to the fact that men of a certain age can be follically challenged?</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>If you’re follically challenged it means you’re losing your hair! Having little or no hair is called <strong>baldness</strong></span><span>. And if you’ve reached </span><strong><span>a certain age</span></strong><span> it means you aren’t young any more!</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Tim<br/></span></strong><span>Why is our hair so important to us, Neil? When we aren’t worrying about going bald, we’re busy shaving, waxing, plucking, and trimming the stuff. When I say ‘we’ of course I’m referring to people in general. Not myself…</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, a good head of hair indicates health and youth. And hair on your face – <strong>facial</strong></span><span> hair – shows when boys have reached manhood. </span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Tim<br/></span></strong><span>On the other hand, going grey or losing your hair shows you’re getting older.<br/><br/></span><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Hair today, gone tomorrow?</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Tim<br/></span></strong><span>Bad joke, Neil!</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Sorry! It’s true that hair on your head shows signs of aging – but this isn’t true of all human hair. Let’s listen to Ralf Paus, a leading hair loss researcher, talking about this.<br/><br/></span><strong><span>INSERT<br/></span></strong><strong><span>Ralf Paus, hair loss researcher<br/></span></strong><span>The eyebrows get stronger usually in aging men, the hairs in your nose and in your ears get stronger – and what a miracle of nature that an organ – when the entire body is aging actually grows stronger. So we may even be able to learn from hair follicles how not to age. </span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Tim<br/></span></strong><span>Hmm. I’m not sure I would swap a good head of hair for thick eyebrows and nose hair. How about you, Neil?</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>I agree! But let’s hear more from Ralf Paus about why some hair gets stronger as you get older.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>INSERT<br/></span></strong><strong><span>Ralf Paus, hair loss researcher<br/></span></strong><span>The hair follicle apparently knows some tricks that the other organs don’t know. So it’s continuously regenerating itself. It goes through a so-called hair cycle and part of that we know pretty well – and that is, these stem cells that it uses to regenerate cells.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Tim<br/></span></strong><span>So a hair follicle can <strong>regenerate</strong></span><span> cells – or grow new cells to replace old or damaged ones. But if that’s only true for eyebrows, nose and ear hair, I am not that impressed! I want hairs on my head to be able to regenerate!</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>The important thing here is that these cells in the hair follicle may help scientists discover a way to stop other organs of the body aging… OK, I’m now going to reveal how many hair follicles on average we have on our bodies. The answer is… 5 million. </span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Tim<br/></span></strong><span>Oh. So not 50 million then.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Don’t worry, Tim! It was a tricky question! Now let’s go over the words we learned today.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Tim<br/></span></strong><span>‘Hair-raising’ means scary often in an exciting way. For example, “That ride on the rollercoaster was a hair-raising experience!” </span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Next is ‘hair follicle’ – the organ that produces a hair underneath the skin.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Tim<br/></span></strong><span>“Scientists believe that stress can affect hair follicles.”</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>A number of things can affect hair follicles actually – age, disease, diet…</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Tim<br/></span></strong><span>OK – but we haven’t got all day, Neil. So let’s move on to the next item. ‘Baldness’ – which means having little or no hair on your head.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>“My grandfather is bald and he always wears a hat to cover his baldness.”</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Tim<br/></span></strong><span>Nice example. Is your grandpa actually bald, Neil?</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>No – he has a fine head of hair. Now, if you are a certain age, it means you are no longer young. For example…</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Tim<br/></span></strong><span>“All the people at the party were of a certain age…”</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>How many of them had facial hair, Tim? That’s our next word, and ‘facial’ means to do with the face.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Tim<br/></span></strong><span>“None of the people at the party had facial hair.” There’s your answer!</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>That’s unusual, Tim. Lots of men have beards these days. OK – our final word for today is ‘regenerate’ which means to grow again. You can talk about regenerating a range of things, for example…</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>“The council has plans to regenerate this part of the city.”</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Tim<br/></span></strong><span>“Regeneration of parts of the city is in progress.” – ‘regeneration’ is the noun.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, it’s time to go now. But if today’s show gave you goosebumps please let us know by visiting our Twitter, Facebook and YouTube pages and telling us about it!</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Tim<br/></span></strong><span>Bye-bye!</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Goodbye!</span></p>",Transcript,<p><strong>hair-raising</strong><br/>scary often in an exciting way </p><p><strong>hair follicle</strong><br/>the organ that produces a hair underneath the skin </p><p><strong>baldness</strong><br/>having little or no hair on your head </p><p><strong>of a certain age</strong><br/>no longer young </p><p><strong>facial</strong><br/>to do with the face </p><p><strong>regenerate</strong><br/>to grow again </p>,Vocabulary

In this programme we bring you an expressive topic and six items of vocabulary. I’m Neil…</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Tim<br/></span></strong><span>And I’m Tim. So, we had an argument just before we started the show…<br/><br/></span><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>We did, Tim. But no hard feelings?</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Tim<br/></span></strong><span>None. <strong>No hard feelings</strong></span><span> is something you say to somebody you have argued with to say you’d still like to be friends. We often fall out over silly things…</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>… Like who’s going to introduce the show…</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Tim<br/></span></strong><span>… Or who’s going to choose the quiz question.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>But we understand each other. That’s the important thing, isn't it? <strong>To fall out with somebody</strong></span><span> by the way, is another way of saying to argue or disagree with them. Do you know that you wave your arms around a lot when you’re arguing, Tim?</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Tim<br/></span></strong><span>No, I didn’t know I did that.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>That isn’t very British.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Tim<br/></span></strong><span>I know. Using <strong>gestures</strong></span><span> – or movements you make with your hands or your head to express what you are thinking of feeling – is common in some countries but not in others. Then there are some movements – like shaking your head – which mostly means ‘no’ but in some countries can mean the opposite. </span><span> </span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>That’s right. In which country does shaking your head mean ‘yes’, Tim? Is it… <br/></span><span>a) Greece,<br/></span><span>b) Japan or <br/></span><span>c) Bulgaria?</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Tim<br/></span></strong><span>No idea – I’ll guess Greece. I do know that in India people shake their heads to mean lots of different things. </span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>There are plenty of gestures you need to be careful with when you’re meeting and greeting people from a culture that’s different to your own – to avoid offending people – or making an awkward faux pas…</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Tim<br/></span></strong><span>If you make a<strong> faux pas</strong></span><span> it means you say or do something embarrassing in a social situation. For example, our every day use of the thumbs-up signal might offend people from the Middle East.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And <strong>to offend</strong></span><span> means to make somebody angry or upset.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Tim<br/></span></strong><span>Let’s hear now from Business Professor Erin Meyer talking about how easy it is to misunderstand why people behave the way they do in everyday situations when we don’t belong to the same culture.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>INSERT<br/></span></strong><strong><span>Erin Meyer, Business Professor in Dubai<br/></span></strong><span>A while ago I was in Dubai and one of my students, my Emirati students, was driving me home after a session and the car stopped at a light and she rolled down the window, and she started shouting at someone outside of the window. This guy was crossing the street with a big box of cloth. And he started shouting back, and she opened up the door, and they started gesticulating and shouting at one another. And I thought, wow, they’re having a huge fight, I thought maybe he was going to hit her. And she got back in the car, and I said, well, what were you fighting about? And she said, ‘Oh no, no, we weren’t fighting, he was giving me directions to your hotel.’ And I thought that was a great example of how someone from another culture may misperceive or misunderstand something as a fight when in fact they were just being emotionally expressive.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span><strong>Gesticulating</strong> – what does that mean?</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Tim<br/></span></strong><span>It means what I was doing earlier! – Waving your arms around to express what you’re feeling. </span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Erin Meyer was worried because her student and the man on the street were shouting and gesticulating at each other. She thought they were having a fight when in fact they were just being emotionally expressive.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Tim<br/></span></strong><span>And <strong>expressive </strong></span><span>means showing what you think or feel.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>You were nodding in agreement, there, Tim. Which reminds me of our quiz question. In which country does shaking your head mean ‘yes’? Is it… a) Greece, b) Japan or c) Bulgaria?</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Tim<br/></span></strong><span>I said Greece…</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And that’s the wrong answer, I’m afraid. The right answer is Bulgaria. In some Southeastern European areas such as Bulgaria and southern Albania, shaking your head is used to indicate ""yes"". In those regions, nodding in fact means ""no"" as well. </span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Tim<br/></span></strong><span>I hope I remember that the next time I meet somebody from Southeastern Europe.</span><span>OK, shall we look back at the words we learned today?</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>‘No hard feelings’ is something you say to somebody you have argued with or beaten in a game or contest to say you’d still like to be friends. </span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Tim<br/></span></strong><span>For example, “I always get the quiz questions right – unlike you Neil. But no hard feelings, OK?”</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>That’s not a very realistic example, Tim… But I’ll let it go. Number two – ‘to fall out with somebody’ means to argue or disagree with them.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Tim<br/></span></strong><span>“I fell out with my best friend at school. We didn’t talk to each other for a whole week!”</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>That must’ve been a serious disagreement, Tim! What were you arguing about?<br/><br/></span><strong><span>Tim<br/></span></strong><span>I can’t remember. It was a long time ago. Number three – a ‘gesture’ is a movement you make with your hands or head to express what you are thinking or feeling.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>“She opened her arms wide in a gesture of welcome.”</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Tim<br/></span></strong><span>Or the verb – “I gestured to Neil that we only had one minute left to finish the show!”</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Is that true, Tim? You’re nodding your head – but we should also quickly mention ‘gesticulate’ which means to make gestures with your hands or arms! </span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Tim<br/></span></strong><span>A ‘faux pas’ is saying or doing something embarrassing in a social situation. For example, “I committed a serious faux pas at a party last night – that I’m too embarrassed to tell you about!”</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Oh dear, Tim. I hope you didn’t offend too many people – ‘offend’ is our next word – and it means to make somebody angry or upset.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Tim<br/></span></strong><span>Well, you’ve given us a good example already, Neil, so let’s move on to the final word – ‘expressive’ – which means showing what you think or feel.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>“Tim has a very expressive face.”</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Tim<br/></span></strong><span>Thanks! Another quick example – “I waved my hand expressively to signal to Neil that it was time to finish the show.”</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Taking my cue from Tim, that’s all for today. But please remember to check out our Instagram, Twitter, Facebook and YouTube pages. </span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Tim<br/></span></strong><span>Bye-bye!</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>Goodbye!</p>",Transcript,<p><strong>no hard feelings</strong><br/> is something you say to somebody you have argued with or beaten in a game or contest to say you’d still like to be friends </p><p><strong>to fall out with somebody</strong><br/>to argue or disagree with them </p><p><strong>gesture</strong><br/>a movement you make with your hands or head to express what you are thinking or feeling </p><p><span><strong>faux pas</strong><br/></span><span>saying or doing something embarrassing in a social situation<br/></span></p><p><strong>offend</strong><br/>to make somebody angry or upset<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>expressive</strong><br/>showing what you think or feel </p>,Vocabulary

Why are you wearing a policeman’s hat, Tim?</p><p><strong>Tim<br/></strong>To get me in the mood for our topic today – uniforms!<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, the hat certainly suits you!<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Tim<br/></strong>And if something <strong>suits you</strong> it looks good on you! Well, thanks, Neil. And funnily enough, I have a question for you on the subject of police hats! In the 19th century, police officers' top hats could be used…<br/><br/>a) to stand on,<br/>b) as a weapon or<br/>c) to protect their heads from the sun?<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, they're kind of pointy so I’m going to say as a weapon.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Tim<br/></strong>OK. Let’s consider what the point of a uniform is. Why do some jobs have them while others don’t?<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>Well – The police, and other emergency services, like the fire brigade, and ambulance service – they need practical clothes to help them do their job.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Tim<br/></strong>People need to recognize them too, don’t they?<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yeah, that’s right.

Let’s listen to cultural historian, Joe Moran, talking about why wearing a uniform can also allow you to behave differently to the way you normally behave.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Joe Moran, cultural historian<br/></strong>It’s a role and a genre that you adopt and it’s kind of – it’s something that’s not quite you. It’s kind of a persona that you can put on. In Germany they call it ‘maskenfreiheit’, which is the freedom conferred by masks. There’s something about taking on what is very clearly a persona or professional role, that can be liberating, I think.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So when you put on a uniform you are adopting a role or genre. <strong>Genre</strong> means a particular style. And a <strong>persona</strong> is a character you present to the outside world – as opposed to the person you feel like inside.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Tim<br/></strong>Joe Moran compares putting on a persona to putting on a mask. And he says this can be very <strong>liberating</strong>. But do you really think putting on a uniform liberates – or frees – us from the person we really are?<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>Maybe. If you’re shy, for example, a uniform might feel liberating because it allows you to behave more confidently. So, if you could choose a uniform and a new persona, what would it be, Tim?<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Tim<br/></strong>Hmm. An airline pilot, I think. I’d look great in a blazer with brass buttons – and with the cap and mirror sunglasses. Hello, this is your captain speaking. We’ll shortly be arriving at LAX airport in sunny Los Angeles. Local time is 12.55 and it’s hot hot hot outside, so I hope you’ve packed plenty of sun cream.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>OK Tim, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop! I can see you’d love being a pilot – or at least you’d love talking to your passengers!<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Tim<br/></strong>What about you, Neil? What would you like to try on for size? A surgeon’s scrubs? A nun’s habit?<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong><strong>To try something on for size</strong> means to decide whether it’s what you want or not. No Tim… I’d go for a chef’s apron, checked trousers, a tall hat.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Tim<br/></strong>I think the uniform would suit you, but are you good at cooking, Neil?<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I’m an excellent cook. Now, I think we should have the answer to today’s quiz question, Tim.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Tim<br/></strong>Yes, I asked what a police officer’s hat could be used for in the 19th century.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I said as a weapon.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Tim<br/></strong>Wrong, I’m afraid. From 1829 to 1839, Metropolitan Police officers wore a cane-reinforced top hat, which could be used as a step to climb or see over walls. I wonder if modern police hats are strong enough to stand on?<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>We’ll try yours later and find out. But now let’s go over the other key words we learned today.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Tim<br/></strong>OK. If something ‘suits you’, it looks good on you. For example, “Does this pilot’s uniform suit me, Neil?”<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>It suits you down to the ground, Tim! And that means it suits you very well!<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Tim<br/></strong>Number two – If something ‘stands out’, it’s noticeable or easy to see.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>“My colourful suit really stood out at the party.”<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Tim<br/></strong>In a good way, I hope! OK, next item – ‘to fit in’ – means you belong to a particular group and are accepted by them.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>“I never fitted in with the cool kids at school.”<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I’m sorry to hear that, Tim! Maybe you weren’t wearing the right uniform? Number four is ‘persona’ – the character you present to the outside world – as opposed to the person you feel like inside.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Tim<br/></strong>“My work persona is confident and chatty but I’m actually rather shy.”<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I’m learning a lot about you today, Tim!<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Tim<br/></strong>They’re just examples, Neil. I don’t have a work persona – that’s the nice thing about our job – there’s no need to put on masks or personas.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Just the occasional hat…<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Tim<br/></strong>Indeed. And a very nice hat this is too – I think I’ll keep it. Now, let’s finish the vocabulary! Number five – ‘liberating’ means feeling you can behave however you like.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>For example, “Talking openly about your problems can be very liberating.”<br/><br/><strong>Tim<br/></strong>And finally, ‘to try something on for size’ means to test something to decide whether you want it or not.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Our listeners can try these new vocabulary items on for size and decide whether they’ll be useful or not!<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Tim<br/></strong>And if not, then please let us know by visiting our Twitter, Facebook and YouTube pages and telling us what you think!<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Goodbye!<br/> <br/> <strong>Tim<br/></strong>Bye!</p>",Transcript,<p><strong>suits you</strong><br/>looks good on you</p><p><strong>stand out</strong><br/>it’s noticeable or easy to see</p><p><strong>to fit in</strong><br/>belong to a particular group and are accepted by them</p><p><strong>persona</strong><br/>the character you present to the outside world – as opposed to the person you feel like inside</p><p><strong>liberating</strong><br/>feeling you can behave however you like</p>,Vocabulary

Neil and Tim discuss the dangers of laughter and teach you some related words.", 31 Aug 2017,"<p><em>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript</em><span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English, where we bring you an entertaining topic and six related items of vocabulary. I'm Neil… and those guffaws you can hear are coming from Tim. So what's so funny, Tim?<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Tim<br/></strong>Can you pass me a glass of water?<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, OK, here you go.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Tim<br/></strong>It was just something our producer said before I came into the studio. A <strong>guffaw</strong> by the way is a loud laugh that you can't control...<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So while Tim <strong>laughs his head off</strong> – and that means to laugh very loudly for a long time – I'll introduce the show. Today, Tim, we're talking about laughter and how it could kill you…<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Tim<br/></strong>Oh come on, Neil! That's not funny! Laughing is good for you – everyone knows that!<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, not when you laugh like that, Tim! You're bright red in the face, you've got tears streaming down your face. And you nearly choked on a glass of water! <strong>Choke </strong>means to stop breathing because something is blocking your throat by the way. Now, without laughing or choking, can you please tell me how many times a day the average adult laughs? Is it…<br/>a) 17,<br/>b) 70 or<br/>c) 700?<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Tim<br/></strong>Hmm. Surely it depends on what type of person you are?<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Maybe it does. That's why I'm asking about the average number of times Tim, so just make an intelligent guess.<br/><br/><strong>Tim<br/></strong>OK, well I laugh a lot so I'm going to say 70 times a day. 700 times seems like you'd be laughing all the time… But you've worried, me Neil – I know we sometimes say, I nearly died laughing – but nobody does actually die laughing, do they?<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, I think the risk of dying of laughter is probably low – but in theory, what happens when we laugh is potentially dangerous! Let's listen to cognitive neuroscientist Sophie Scott talking about what happens when we laugh.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>INSERT<br/> </strong><strong>Sophie Scott, cognitive neuroscientist<br/></strong>Laughter – in a competition for control over your ribcage in your brain between laughter and breathing and speaking – laughter will always win. And laughter just takes those same muscles and it squeezes them – eh eh eh eh – and the air goes – out out out out – and notably it does not want to let you breathe in. It's trying to kill you. It's quite dangerous.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Tim<br/></strong>So when you laugh a lot your <strong>diaphragm</strong> – that's the sheet of muscle below your lungs – contracts and squeezes the air out of your lungs.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>This makes it hard to breathe – which is why you were gasping for breath earlier, Tim! And that's why laughter can kill you!<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Tim<br/></strong><strong>Gasping</strong> means having difficulty breathing. Well, I've caught my breath now – I didn't die – and I think it's fair to say, Neil, that laughter is good for you. When you laugh, your body releases happy hormones… And according to some research, people feel less pain as a result of having a good laugh.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So scientists are saying laughter is a sort of natural painkiller?<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Tim<br/> </strong>Apparently, yes. They've done research where they make people laugh, and then test their pain levels afterwards. And they found that if people only chuckle a bit it doesn't act as a painkiller, but if you laugh a lot, it does.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So a chuckle sounds like this [chuckles]. <strong>Chuckling</strong> means to laugh quietly. So you need belly laughter then – great big guffaws?<br/><br/><strong>Tim<br/></strong>That's right. A guffaw is pretty much the opposite of a chuckle. I was guffawing earlier in the show. Would you like to demonstrate your own guffaw, Neil?<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>[hearty guffaw]<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Tim<br/></strong>Fantastic – can I try pinching you now, and test whether you feel any pain?<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>No, you can't, Tim. It's time for the answer to today's quiz question. I asked you:<span><br/></span></p><p>How many times a day does the average adult laugh? Is it… a) 17, b) 70 or c) 700?<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Tim<br/></strong>I said 70…<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Sorry. The right answer is actually 17 – less than you thought I'm afraid, Tim. But children laugh on average 300 times a day.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Tim<br/></strong>That's a big difference! You see, Neil, we all need to laugh more. You shouldn't be trying to tell us that laughing is dangerous.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Maybe you're right. So let's move on and go over the words we learned today. The first one is 'guffaw' – which is a loud laugh that you can't control...<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Tim<br/></strong>“Neil surprised us with his deep guffaw.”<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Next up – number two – to 'laugh your head off' – means to laugh very loudly for a long time.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Tim<br/></strong>“It's a really funny movie – you'll laugh your head off!”<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>OK – number three – 'choke' means to stop breathing because something is blocking your throat.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Tim<br/></strong>“I nearly choked to death on a cheese sandwich.”<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Poor Tim – you should eat more slowly! 'Diaphragm' is our next word, and that's the sheet of muscle separating your lungs from your stomach. We use our diaphragms for breathing, talking, and laughing!<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Tim<br/></strong>“Do opera singers have more powerful diaphragms than other people?”<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I don't know the answer to that, Tim. So number five, which is 'gasping', which means having difficulty breathing. “He was gasping for breath as he swam to the surface of the swimming pool.”</p><p><strong>Tim<br/></strong>But 'gasp' also means to be shocked or surprised by something. For example, “I gasped in astonishment when I heard Neil laugh.”<span data-mce-mark=""1""><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Our final word is 'chuckle' which means to laugh quietly.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Tim<br/></strong>“The audience chuckled through the show but they didn't seem very amused.”<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Oh dear. Well I hope our audience has been amused today. If you're looking for more laughs, then please check out our Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube pages. You may find something to make you chuckle or guffaw there.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Tim and Neil<br/></strong>Bye!</p>",Transcript,<p><strong>guffaw</strong><br/>a loud laugh that you can't control</p><p><strong>laugh your head off</strong><br/>laugh very loudly for a long time</p><p><strong>choke</strong><br/>to stop breathing because something is blocking your throat</p><p><strong>diaphragm</strong><br/>the sheet of muscle separating your lungs from your stomach</p><p><strong>gasping</strong><br/>having difficulty breathing</p>,Vocabulary

Neil and Rob wonder if we are slaves of time., 24 Aug 2017,"<p><em>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript</em><span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Hello, I'm Neil. And welcome to 6 Minute English, where we bring you an interesting topic and six related items of vocabulary. But … there should be two of us … and my co-presenter Rob hasn't arrived … Rob? …. Rob! … You're late!<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Am I? What's the time?<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>It's time to start the show. Do you actually own a watch?<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>No. I rely on my internal clock – it's pretty good.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>No, it isn't – you're late!<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>But I'm usually on time. Now today, we're talking about what would happen to the world if all the clocks stopped.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>It seems like that wouldn't worry you much, Rob.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>You're right. I think we're slaves to time – we've got digital clocks on everything – smartphones, computers, microwaves, bus stops – it's hard to get away from it. Did you know the word time is the most common noun in the English language, according to the Oxford English Dictionary?<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Oh, well, I didn't know that, Rob! But good timekeeping is extremely important – there are so many things to schedule in a day, and so many deadlines to meet…<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Tick… tock… tick… tock… Well, before we <strong>run out of time</strong> Neil – and that means use it all up – let's have a quiz question. Can you tell me what the word 'clock' originally referred to? Is it …<br/>a) a pendulum,<br/>b) a bell or  <br/>c) a dial?<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>A <strong>pendulum</strong> is a stick with a weight on the end that swings regularly from side to side. And a <strong>dial</strong> is the round part of a clock, but there are dials on loads of things – they aren't just on clocks. And a bell… is… well…  a bell!<br/><br/><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well, hurry up, Neil – you're wasting time with all these explanations!<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>That's cheeky coming from you, Rob. I think the answer is probably 'bell'.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well, you could be right – because not all timepieces go tick tock. In fact, mechanical clocks and watches are quite recent in the history of timekeeping.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong><strong>Mechanical</strong> means to do with machines. So in the past, before people had mechanical timepieces, how did they know when to arrive at work, for example – or when to finish?<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>They would have looked up at the sky, and observed how the position of the sun, the moon, and the stars changed as time passed.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>That doesn't sound very precise!<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong><strong>Precise</strong> means accurate or exact. It was precise enough for many people. Let's listen to the Director of the Museum of the History of Science in Oxford, Dr Silke Ackermann talking about this.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Dr Silke Ackermann, Director of the Museum of the History of Science in Oxford<br/></strong>We certainly gain precision but we completely get devolved or divorced from where time originally came from. The time we use was based on the movement of the sun and it's roughly still in sync but… for many societies it wasn't at all relevant to know that it's four o'clock. They needed to know how much daylight have I got left, or when is the prayer time I need to observe for completely different reasons, and whilst precision is wonderful it's also very much a straitjacket. Everybody is dominated by… looking at the watch and smartphone all the time, when we observe people. So we basically became a slave to time.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So in the past, they had different reasons for wanting to know the time, is that it?<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes – in ancient times, people were concerned about the changing of the seasons and how this affected them. When it was time to plants crops, or when to harvest them. When the rainy season was going to start…<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Now you mention it, in the Muslim world, the start of Ramadan is traditionally calculated by the rising of the crescent moon – which changes every year. And you can't calculate that with modern methods of timekeeping.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>You're catching on, Neil! Now, what does Dr Ackermann mean when she says precision is a <strong>straitjacket</strong>?<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>She means that always wanting to be precise about time can limit what we do in a way that is damaging.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>So we need to take our time – relax a bit… That's my philosophy for life.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>But we are seriously running out of time now, Rob – so please hurry up and tell us the answer to today's quiz question.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>OK. Well, the answer is bell. So, you were right, Neil! The word clock is derived from the Celtic words clagan and clocca meaning ""bell"". A silent instrument that doesn't have a bell has traditionally been known as a timepiece. But today a ""clock"" refers to any device for measuring and displaying the time.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, moving quickly on, let's go through the words we learned today. First up was 'run out of time' – or use it all up. You can run out of pretty much anything…<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>'Oh no! We've run out of sugar! Who's going to the shops to buy some more?'<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil</strong><span><br/></span>Number two – 'pendulum' – a stick with a weight on the end that swings regularly from side to side, controlling the movement of a clock.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>'The pendulum on my Grandfather Clock has stopped swinging.'<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Sorry to hear that, Rob. Number three – a 'dial' is the round part of a clock. But more generally, it refers to a round instrument that shows you the amount of something, for example, heat, pressure or speed.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>'The hands moved slowly round the clock dial.'<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Phones used to have dials that you turned to make a phone call. Here's the verb: 'I dialled his number but he didn't answer.'<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Alfred Hitchcock made a film called 'Dial M for Murder'! OK – number four is 'mechanical' – to do with machines. 'Our plane was delayed because of a mechanical problem.'<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Number five – 'precise' – which means accurate and exact. So 'What type of mechanical problem? Could you be more precise, Rob?'<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>No, I don't have time, Neil! Number six is 'straitjacket'.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Which means limiting what somebody can do in a way that is damaging. It's also a jacket with long arms that are tied behind a person to stop them from behaving violently.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>'Oh, no, not the straitjacket! I promise I'll behave myself, Neil.'<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>OK, if you really promise, Rob.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Right. Well, we've run out of time! Please check out our Instagram, Twitter, Facebook and YouTube pages.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Goodbye!<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/> Bye-bye!</p>",Transcript,"<p><strong>run out of time</strong><br/>use it all up<br/><br/><strong>pendulum<br/></strong>a stick with a weight on the end that swings regularly from side to side</p><p><strong>dial</strong><br/>the round part of a clock (but more generally, it refers to a round instrument that shows you the amount of something, for example, heat, pressure or speed)</p><p><strong>mechanical</strong><br/>it has to do with machines<br/><br/><strong>precise</strong><br/>accurate and exact </p><p><strong>straitjacket</strong><br/>limiting what somebody can do in a way that is damaging.

Neil is not interested. What makes people want to share them? Listen to the programme., 17 Aug 2017,"<p><em>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript</em> </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Hello. I'm Neil. Welcome to 6 Minute English, where we like to share…</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Jokes, funny stories and cat videos… </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>No, Rob – we like to share six useful items of vocabulary. </p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes, that too. But first, check out this meme on my phone, Neil – Grumpy Cat – it's so cute! Shall I send it to you?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>No, please don't! A <strong>meme</strong> is a picture or video with an amusing caption that a lot of people share with each other online. Well, in this programme we're talking about why some online content goes viral… </p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>… and some doesn't. This cat is cute because it looks so <strong>grumpy</strong> – and that means 'bad tempered'. </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>An image, video, or other piece of information <strong>goes</strong> <strong>viral</strong> when it gets passed on very quickly from person to person on the internet. </p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>So first let's start with our quiz question, Neil. Can you tell me which was one of the first videos to go viral on the internet? Was it…<br/>a) Charlie bit my finger,<br/>b) Sneezing Panda or<br/>c) Dancing Baby? </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I'm going to guess 'Sneezing Panda' – because I haven't seen any of those videos. </p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>That's ridiculous Neil. Have you been living under a rock? </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Look, I just don't find silly videos particularly cute – or funny. </p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>OK, OK, no need to get grumpy about it. Let's move on. Why do so many people – Neil excluded – enjoy sharing content online? Let's listen to Dr Jonah Berger, Marketing Professor at the University of Pennsylvania and author of <em>Contagious: Why things catch on</em>, talking about what motivates us to share. </p><p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Dr Jonah Berger, Marketing Professor at the University of Pennsylvania and author<br/></strong>Humans are social animals. Sharing allows us (to) feel connected to others. We share emotions, which allow us to deepen the bonds we have with our peers and with our friends. </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So it's all about being connected and deepening the bonds between ourselves and our peers. Our <strong>peers</strong> are people the same age as ourselves who share the same social position in a group.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And we particularly like to share content that makes us feel emotional. Let's hear more from Dr Jonah Berger about this. </p><p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Dr Jonah Berger, Marketing Professor at the University of Pennsylvania and author<br/></strong>High arousal emotions include things like anger and anxiety, but also excitement and humour, low arousal – sadness and contentment. [It] turns out that those high-arousal emotions – those emotions that fire us up and cause us to take action – also drive us to share. </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong><strong>Arousal </strong>means 'to excite a particular feeling in somebody'. And emotions like anger and anxiety tend to cause stronger feelings than sadness and contentment. </p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Right – high-arousal emotions fire us up – and <strong>to fire someone up</strong> means 'to make someone excited and enthusiastic about something'. So when a video we see on the internet makes us laugh – or makes us excited or angry – then we are more likely to share it with others.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And sharing that emotion with others strengthens the connection or bond between us. That's what Dr Berger's theory says anyway. </p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>I'm surprised that sad things aren't passed on as much as, say, funny things. </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, how often do you share sad videos with your peers? </p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Good point. I do tend to share content that makes me laugh – more than sad or angry stuff anyway. Like the Grumpy Cat meme. Can I show it to you now? </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>No. </p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>OK. I'll just show you the caption. It says, ""I purred once. It was terrible"". </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yeah. Right. Hilarious, Rob. Now, can we have the answer to today's quiz question, please, if you've finished amusing yourself? </p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>OK. OK. Which was one of the first videos to go viral on the internet?  Was it… a) Charlie Bit my Finger, b) Sneezing Panda or c) Dancing Baby? </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I said 'Sneezing Panda'. </p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well, it was actually Dancing Baby. This 3-dimensional animation of a baby dancing the cha-cha was one of the first viral videos released in the late 1990s. Another popular one was the Hamster Dance by Hampton the Hamster, which appeared in 1997. </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, fascinating as all that sounds, shall we look back at the words we learned today, Rob?<br/><br/><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Sure. The first item was 'meme' – a picture or video with an amusing caption that a lot of people share with each other online. For example, ""I tried to show Neil a hilarious meme about a grumpy cat."" </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>The word 'meme' was actually invented by evolutionary biologist Professor Richard Dawkins to represent an idea or concept that spreads in human culture in a similar way to a gene. </p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Fascinating. That sounds way too complicated, Neil. Let's move on to item number two – 'grumpy' – I gave one example just now. But here's another one: ""He's the grumpiest man I've ever met."" </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I hope you're not talking about me, Rob. Number three – 'to go viral' – means 'an image, video, or other piece of information that gets passed on very quickly from person to person on the Internet'. For example, ""What makes a video go viral?""</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>I don't know, Neil – If I knew how to make a viral video, I'd be a rich man by now! </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Before computers and the internet we only talked about viral infections, didn't we? ""I've got a nasty viral infection so I'm not coming into work today."" </p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yeah, that's right. The connection is that both viral infections and viral memes spread quickly! </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>OK – number four. 'Peers' are people the same age as our selves who share the same social position in a group. </p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>For example, ""Teenagers often worry about looking silly in front of their peers."" Next up – arousal – that means 'to excite a particular feeling in somebody'. </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>We heard about high and low-arousal emotions. The verb is 'to arouse'. For example, ""The debate aroused strong feelings on both sides."" </p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>OK, finally – 'to fire someone up' means 'to make someone excited and enthusiastic about something'. ""I'm really fired up about today's vocabulary!"" </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Good to know, Rob. But it's time to go now, but please check out our Instagram, Twitter, Facebook and YouTube pages. </p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Bye-bye! </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Goodbye! </p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Shall we watch that 'dancing baby' now, Neil? </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>No.</p>",Transcript,<p><strong>meme<br/></strong>a picture or video with an amusing caption that a lot of people share with each other online<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>grumpy<br/></strong>bad tempered!</p><p><strong><span>goes</span></strong><span> <strong>viral<br/></strong></span><span>when something (e.g. a video or picture) gets passed on very quickly from person to person on the internet</span></p><p><span> <strong>peers<br/></strong>people the same age as ourselves who share the same social position in a group</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong>arousal (to arouse)<br/></strong>to excite a particular feeling in somebody</p><p><strong>to fire someone up<br/></strong>to make someone excited and enthusiastic about something</p>,Vocabulary

Now, here's a serious question for you, Neil. Have you thought about what you'd like to happen when you die?<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Interesting way to start the show, Rob… No, I haven't.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well, nobody really likes to talk about death, do they?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, it isn't a fun topic. So, can we talk about something else, please?<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Afraid not. Because today's topic is funerals – a <strong>funeral</strong> is a ceremony we hold for a dead person.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And a <strong>ceremony</strong> is a formal event performed on special occasions – like a wedding or a graduation – or in this case, a funeral.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>OK. Well, let's start with a quiz question. According to a UK survey, how many of us would like our funerals to be more of a party or celebration? Is it…<br/>a) 5%,<br/>b) 25% or<br/>c) 50%?<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, I think it's 25%. I hadn't thought about it before – but I'd definitely prefer my funeral to be a celebration. With my favourite music playing – and definitely nobody wearing black…<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well, strangely enough, a friend of mine went to a funeral recently where the funeral director was dressed as Darth Vader from Star Wars!<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Hmm. That sounds wrong. But I guess people are choosing to move away from the traditional funeral – you know, in church, people dressed in black, all very quiet…<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Darth Vader does wear black, at least! Anyway, let's hear from Shonnie Sullivan here in the UK talking about the fancy dress funeral she and her sister organized for their mother.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Shonnie</strong>: It was quite unusual as we turned up in fancy dress.<br/><strong>Interviewer</strong>: Had your mum left instructions about how she wanted her funeral to be?<br/><strong>Shonnie</strong>:Only that we don't cry, and we… to have a party to celebrate her life. Be happy, don't be sad… I was a witch.<br/><strong>Interviewer</strong>: How did you look?<br/><strong>Shonnie</strong>: Oh, it was just a little black dress and I just had, like, a little fancy witch hat on – the same as my sister. And we had a very close friend of the family come as Beetlejuice – which was absolutely amazing. He really did go all out for that.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>So<strong> fancy dress</strong> - special clothes you wear to an event – to look like a famous person or character from a movie. Another word we use is<strong> costume </strong>– which is a set of clothes you wear to look like somebody else.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Shonnie and her sister chose a Halloween theme for the funeral and wore witches' costumes – little black dresses with special hats.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>A close family relative dressed as Beetlejuice … Did he dress as a squashed insect, Neil? I'm confused here!<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>No, Rob. He dressed as Beetlejuice, the main character in a popular 1980s movie. Beetlejuice is a ghost who wears crazy clothes, and has scary hair and make up.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Hmm. I haven't seen the film. But what does Shonnie mean when she says her relative went ‘all out' with his costume?<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong><strong>To go all out</strong> means to make a big effort – and this guy's costume involved not only special clothes, but special hair and make up too.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Like me.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>What do you mean, 'like me'?<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well, I go all out to get my clothes and hair just right for 6 Minute English.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, and, well... you look great, Rob. But unfortunately nobody sees us… do they?<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes, good point. But it's important to make an effort.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So have you had any thoughts about the sort of funeral <em>you</em> would like to have?<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Oooh… Yes, I like the thought of my friends and family saying their final goodbyes to me on a beach with a beautiful sunset, listening to Stairway to Heaven by Led Zeppelin…<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>OK, well, before you get too carried away with ideas for your own funeral, let's have the answer to today's quiz question.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong><strong>To get carried away</strong> means to get very excited and lose control of your feelings! I never thought I would get excited about my own funeral… But anyway – yes, back to today's question! How many of us would like our funerals to be more of a party or celebration? Is it… a) 5%, b) 25%, or c) 50%?<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I said 25%.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>No, it's actually 50%. The market research company ICN found that half of us here in the UK would prefer something different to the traditional funeral.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>More than I expected.OK, shall we look back at the words we have learned today?<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes. First up – 'funeral' – a ceremony we hold for a dead person. The plural is funerals – ""Fancy dress funerals aren't everybody's cup of tea."" The adjective is – funereal – notice the stress on the second syllable – ""Who chose this funereal music? Can we change it to something more cheerful?""<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>'Not my cup of tea' by the way, is something you don't enjoy doing.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>OK – 'ceremony' – a formal event performed on special occasions.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>""I didn't go to my sister's graduation ceremony.""<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>""In the UK, the opening of Parliament is a ceremonious occasion."" Ceremonious is the adjective.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Number three – 'fancy dress' is special clothing you wear to an event – for example, to look like a famous person or character from a movie.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>""I've been invited to a fancy dress party.""<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Who are you going to go as, Rob?<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>It's a secret, Neil!<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Number four – ‘costume' – a set of clothes you wear to look like somebody else. ""Rob is going to go to the fancy-dress party in a Superman costume.""<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Good guess. Right. Number five – 'to go all out' means to make a big effort.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>""We went all out this year with our Christmas decorations – with a life-size flashing Santa Claus and sleigh.""<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Way to go, Neil! Number six – the phrasal verb 'to get carried away' – means to get very excited and lose control of your feelings!<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>""She got carried away and painted the whole house pink.""<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>That must be Barbie's house…<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yup – and fancy dress is definitely Barbie's cup of tea! OK, that's all for today. But please remember to check out our Instagram, Twitter, Facebook and YouTube pages.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>OK.

So I was watching an old Woody Allen movie last night…<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>OK. Is he the anxious middle-aged guy from New York who talks about his problems all the time?<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>That's the one. He was paying for… psychoanalysis – and that's a type of talk therapy that was popular in the 1970s. Do you know what therapy means, Rob?<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes.<strong> Therapy</strong> means a type of treatment for a problem or illness. And talk therapy is a treatment for <strong>psychological</strong> problems – which means problems of the mind – in case you were struggling with another long Greek word, Neil! Trained therapists work with you on ways to understand your thoughts, feelings and behaviour.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Hey, Rob, I'm an expert on long Greek words. Psychology is the noun, by the way. And the prefix 'psycho' in front of any word means 'to do with the mind'.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>For example the horror movie <em>Psycho</em>… which is all about the disturbed mind of the main character, Norman Bates…<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>…Where<strong> disturbed</strong> means not thinking or behaving in a normal way – because you have psychological problems. Norman Bates would have found talk therapy helpful, don't you think?<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Hmm. I'm not sure really. Anyway, let's have a quiz question – shall we now, Neil? Can you tell me who invented the first talk therapy? Was it… a) Boris Karloff,<br/>b) Carl Jung or<br/>c) Sigmund Freud?<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I'm going to go for Sigmund Freud.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>OK. Interesting answer – we'll find out later whether it was the right one or not. Now, moving on, what do you think is the most common psychological problem today, Neil?<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>It's depression. And <strong>depression</strong> – a feeling of unhappiness that can affect your thoughts, behaviour, and feelings – is the most common psychological problem affecting people throughout the world.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>How depressing! That's the adjective! It makes me feel depressed just thinking about it.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And depressed is the adjective we use to describe how we are feeling. Don't feel depressed, Rob! Let's listen to Professor Brent Roberts from the University of Illinois to find out more about the benefits of talk therapy.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Professor Brent Roberts from the University of Illinois<br/></strong>Seeing a therapist does result in marked changes in psychological functioning. So people get less depressed and they get less anxious, and it seems to be regardless of what type of intervention is engaged in. And that is… and that has been one of the more positive aspects of the therapy research that we've seen.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So when people talk to therapists about their problems, it results in marked changes in their psychological functioning – <strong>marked</strong> here means obvious or noticeable.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And these marked changes are that people become less depressed and anxious!<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>An <strong>intervention</strong>, by the way, is something you do to improve a medical problem – and in this context, it refers to different types of talk therapy.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>But why is talking about our problems helpful, Neil?<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I think it gives a shape to our problems. It makes them seem clearer – and that's a first step in being able to manage them. Also, ""a problem shared is a problem halved"", as the saying goes.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>There's also some scientific evidence that talk therapy can change the way we think and feel – by replacing negative thought patterns with positive ones.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Medication can also change the way we think and feel. Some people take pills to treat depression.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>But medication can have negative effects, for example it can make you feel sleepy during the daytime.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, here's a positive thought – let's check how much we've learned today by going over today's vocabulary! We had therapy…<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Therapy is a type of treatment for a problem or illness. There's therapy – therapist – therapeutic.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>My therapist is using a new therapy with me – it's very therapeutic!<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Therapeutic means 'treating an illness' – but in a more general sense, it can simply mean 'relaxing'. For example, I find listening to music very therapeutic.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>OK. Next up – psychological – relating to the mind. Psychology – psychologist – psychological. Depression and anxiety are both psychological problems.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>My friend is studying psychology at university.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I want to be a famous psychologist.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>A career change at your age, Neil?! You've kept that one a secret. OK. Number three – disturbed – 'not thinking or behaving in a normal way because you have psychological problems'. She was a disturbed young woman.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Or disturbing – I've been having very disturbing dreams recently.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Poor Neil! Disturbing here means 'upsetting or worrying'.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Next item – depression – a feeling of unhappiness that can affect your thoughts, behaviour, and feelings.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>We felt depressed by the news.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>The news was very depressing!<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Alright. Let's lift the mood – marked means 'obvious or noticeable'. There's been a marked improvement in your English homework!<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>There was a marked increase in the company's profits last year!<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And finally – intervention – something you do to improve a problem – medical or otherwise.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Let me intervene at this point – intervene – that's the verb and in this context it means 'to interrupt' – and say we've forgotten the quiz question, Rob!!<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Rob<br/> </strong>Oh, no! Good intervention. Yes, let's remind ourselves of that quiz question: who invented the first talk therapy? And you said Sigmund Freud, which is the right answer, so well done, Neil! Psychoanalysis was invented in the early 1890s by Austrian neurologist Sigmund Freud. The patient lies on a couch and talks about their thoughts, feelings and dreams while the therapist listens. Psychoanalytic sessions typically last 50 minutes and take place 4 to 5 times a week.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>OK. Good to know. But I think I prefer our own brand of talk therapy here on the show. And listeners – you can express your thoughts and feelings by visiting our Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube pages.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Talk to you again soon!

Have you ever cheated anybody? Rob and Neil discuss if honesty comes naturally to people or if it is a product of living in a social group., 27 Jul 2017,"<p><em>Note: This is not a word-for-word</em> <em>transcript</em><span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English, where we bring you an interesting topic and six items of vocabulary. I'm Neil, and joining me is Rob.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Hello there! And today we've got six minutes to talk about honesty and how honest people are – particularly when it comes to spending money. So Neil – what's an 'honesty box'?<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, it's where you pay for something by putting money in a box – but it's up to you to put in the right amount. A small business might use this method to take money for things like parking your car or buying a newspaper because it means you don't need a sales assistant.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>But that means people could take a newspaper or park their car without paying anything! An honesty box relies on people being honest. The adjective <strong>honest</strong> means truthful and not trying to cheat people.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And the noun is honesty – the quality of being truthful. Have you ever cheated an honesty box, Rob?<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Absolutely not! I've never have!<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Honestly?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Honestly! And to<strong> cheat</strong>, by the way, means to trick or deceive someone to get something you want. Honesty is the best policy, as they say… <span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Which of course leads us on to our quiz. <br/><br/><strong>Dan<br/></strong>The 6 minute English quiz! Who said ‘honesty is the best policy’? Was it…</p><p>a) Donald Trump<br/>b) Benjamin Franklin or<br/>c) Richard Nixon?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Honestly, Neil! Everyone will know the answer to that.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>But do you know the answer to that, Rob?<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well, I'll have an honest guess. I think it's b) Benjamin Franklin.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, you might be right, but you might not – we'll find out at the end. I did like your use of 'honestly' there, Rob. We can use the adverb 'honestly' at the beginning of a sentence to show that we're feeling irritated – for example when your co-presenter picks a quiz question that's too easy!<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>OK, OK, let's move on now and hear from Philip Graves, a psychologist, and author of the book <em>Consumerology</em>, who can tell us about why honesty isn't always the best policy.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Philip Graves, Psychologist and author of the book </strong><em><strong>Consumerology</strong><br/></em>The question is not 'Are most consumers honest, the question is 'Are most people honest?' – And the answer to that is 'no'. We have evolved with the capacity to be dishonest. It's part of our evolutionary psychological make up – because if we can gain an advantage over the people around us, we have a greater chance of surviving. Now what's important in that is that we also benefited from being in a social group and that was important in our evolutionary past so there is a balance to strike between the extent to which we can feather our own nest, so to speak, and the risk of being ostracised by the group.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>A <strong>consumer</strong> is a person who buys things or services – for example, food or clothes.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Or the use of a parking space – or a taxi.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Now, if I park my car and don't pay for the parking space, I'm being dishonest, but I'm also saving money.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And Philip Graves says being dishonest is part of our 'psychological make up'. What does that mean?<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Our <strong>psychological make up</strong> is the way the human mind works – the way we think.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And it makes sense to be dishonest if you gain an advantage through this behaviour. So when you take something without paying for it, you save money you can spend on something else. <span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So why do we place such importance on being honest then? – If we benefit from being dishonest?<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Because it's selfish behaviour – which other members of our social group won't like. If everybody acted selfishly and dishonestly all the time, the world would be a very unpleasant place! </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong><strong>Selfish</strong> – meaning only caring about yourself and not about other people. That's a good point, Rob.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes, societies work better if people behave <strong>co-operatively</strong> – which means working together towards shared goals.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So honesty really is the best policy then – at least most of the time! <br/><br/><strong>Dan<br/></strong>And now it's time for the answer to the quiz. Who said ‘honesty is the best policy’?<br/><br/><strong>Neil</strong><br/>What do you think, Rob?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>OK. Was it Benjamin Franklin?<span data-mce-mark=""1""><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And that was… the right answer! Maybe the question was too easy! Benjamin Franklin wrote it in a book of proverbs called <em>Poor Richard's Almanac </em>between 1732 and 1758. Other famous quotes include 'There are no gains without pains' and 'Have you something to do tomorrow? Do it today.' OK let's follow Franklin's wise words and move right ahead with the vocabulary items we learned today.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>First up was the adjective honest – meaning truthful and not trying to cheat people – For example, 'Neil has a very honest face'. OK, then there's … um …. honesty and honestly… the noun and adverb forms.

Neil and Dan explore some fascinating research about 'people-watching' and teach you six items of useful vocabulary in this episode of 6 Minute English. , 20 Jul 2017,"<p><em>Note: This is not a word for word transcript</em></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Welcome to 6 Minute English, the programme where we explore an interesting topic and bring you six items of useful vocabulary. I'm Neil.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>And I'm Dan.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Now, Dan, have you ever wanted to become <strong>invisible</strong>?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong><strong>Invisible</strong> – impossible to see. Of course! Who hasn't?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well how about this: most of us think we <em>are</em> in fact invisible, at least some of the time… We'll be looking at the '<strong>invisibility</strong> <strong>cloak</strong> <strong>illusion</strong>' in this programme.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Fascinating. And in that phrase we heard our first three words. <strong>Invisibility</strong> – the state of being <strong>invisible</strong>. A <strong>cloak</strong> is a long piece of material worn like a coat around the shoulders.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And the third word in that phrase – an <strong>illusion</strong> – is something that seems real but isn't.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>OK, question time. Which of these stories features an <strong>invisibility</strong> <strong>cloak</strong>? Is it…</p><p>a) The Hobbit</p><p>b) Harry Potter</p><p>Or c) The Invisible Man</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I know they are all connected to invisibility, but I'm gonna say…a) The Hobbit.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Ok – we'll reveal the answer later on. Now, let's hear more about this <strong>invisibility cloak</strong> <strong>illusion</strong>. What's the theory, Neil?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Right – imagine you're sitting in a crowded train. People are busy looking at phones and books, but they're also looking at each other.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>They're 'people-watching', as we call it. Yes. Yes, I do that. I do it a lot, if I'm honest!</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So – where does the <strong>invisibility </strong>part come in?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>A team of scientists from Yale University did some experiments on this. Commenting on the research here is neuroscientist Dr Catherine Loveday from Westminster University. What did the Yale team find?</p><p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Dr Catherine Loveday, Neuroscientist, Westminster University</strong></p><p>So this study, they asked people that, first they did a survey and they asked people sat in a canteen how much they were watching somebody, and how much they thought those people were observing them. And there was always a <strong>mismatch</strong>. People always thought they were more observational than the people who were watching them.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>So, people think they observe others more than others watch them. Everyone thinks they aren't observed very much - it's almost as if they're <strong>invisible</strong> to others – or wearing an <strong>invisibility cloak</strong>!</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And the difference between how much they are actually being watched and <em>think </em>they're being watched is what she called a <strong>mismatch</strong>. It's the difference between two things – they're two things which don't 'match'.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>In other words – it's not true that people aren't watching us – which is why the idea of having an <strong>invisibility cloak</strong> is just an <strong>illusion</strong>. This next bit is interesting. Two people were asked to wait in a room. Then they were each asked to make two lists: one, what they noticed about the other person; and two, what <em>they thought</em> the other person noticed about them.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So list one was always longer than list two. Not only that – but there was also an important difference in the content of the lists.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Let's hear again from neuroscientist Dr Catherine Loveday. What was the difference?</p><p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Dr Catherine Loveday, Neuroscientist, Westminster University<br/></strong>When people are observing you they're doing it in a non-<strong>judgemental</strong>, fairly empathic way – and not actually noticing the things that you're <strong>self-conscious</strong> about. So if for example you feel <strong>self-conscious</strong> about a spot on your nose, or something that you're wearing, that won't be what they're noticing. It's a much less <strong>judgemental</strong> form of observation.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Right, so even if we're feeling <strong>self-conscious</strong> about something – that means feeling extra aware of an aspect of ourselves – maybe our appearance or our clothes – we needn't be.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Yes, you don't need to feel <strong>self-conscious</strong>. People aren't being <strong>judgemental</strong>.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And being <strong>judgemental</strong> means being critical.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>That's good news. So even though all I'm thinking about is how badly I need a haircut, the other person is probably noticing something completely different. Back to the question about the <strong>invisibility cloak</strong>. Which story is it in?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I said The Hobbit.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>And it was in fact – Harry Potter. Not only does the garment make you impossible to see, it also protects you against magic spells.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Wow – I need one of those!</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>In The Hobbit, it's a ring that makes you <strong>invisible</strong>, and in The <strong>Invisible</strong> Man, the main character uses chemicals to achieve the same effect.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Now, before we become <strong>invisible </strong>ourselves, how about we go through today's words?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Marvellous. First we had <strong>invisible </strong>– which meansimpossible to see. You could say that stars are <strong>invisible</strong> during the day.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>They're only visible at night.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>We also had <strong>cloak</strong> – who would wear a cloak? Maybe a king or a monk? Or maybe you, Neil?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I'm sure I could look good in a <strong>cloak</strong> – that's a long piece of material worn over the shoulders. What about <strong>illusion</strong>?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong><strong>Illusions</strong> appear to be true, but they're not. It can describe an idea: you could say a politician has the <strong>illusion</strong> that everything he says is true. Then we had <strong>mismatch</strong> – which can refer to the difference between two things which perhaps should be similar: there's a <strong>mismatch</strong> between what Michael says and what he does.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Who's Michael?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Just an example! You could also say that Michael and Simone are an unlikely couple – they seem very different – they're a bit of a <strong>mismatch</strong>.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>What is it with you and Michael?! One, he doesn't exist, and two, I think you're being <strong>judgemental</strong>.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Well, I'm criticising him so, yeah, you're right – I'm being <strong>judgemental</strong>. Perhaps I should stop. It's just that… it's just that I'm in love with Simone myself, and I get all nervous and <strong>self-conscious</strong> when I see her.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>You mean you become embarrassed about what she might think of you – you become <strong>self-conscious</strong>?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>I do.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Even though she doesn't exist either?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Well, only in my examples. Sometimes I wish I really did have an <strong>invisibility cloak</strong>.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Hey, hang on, Dan - where have you gone?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Haha – very funny, I'm still perfectly visible. Time to go – but do visit our Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube pages, and of course our website!</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Goodbye for now.</p><p><strong>Both<br/></strong>Bye!</p>",Transcript,<p><strong>invisible</strong> <br/> impossible to be seen</p><p><strong>cloak<br/></strong>a long piece of material worn over the shoulders like a coat</p><p><strong>illusion<br/></strong>something which appears real but isn't</p><p><strong>mismatch<br/></strong>difference between two things; a bad combination</p><p><strong>judgemental<br/></strong>critical</p><p><strong>self-conscious<br/></strong>too aware of yourself; embarrassed what others think about you</p>,Vocabulary

How do they do it? Neil and Dan explore some of the theories in this episode of 6 Minute English.", 13 Jul 2017,"<p><em>Note: This is not a word for word</em> <em>transcript</em></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Welcome to 6 Minute English, the programme where we bring you an interesting topic and six useful words or phrases. I'm Neil.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>And I'm Dan. Today we're talking about one of the last mysteries of science. No, not if the universe will keep expanding forever, but this: how do cats and dogs find their way home over long distances?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>We hear incredible stories of lost pets travelling tens and even hundreds of miles home – but scientists struggle to explain how they do it.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>We'll hear the view of one scientist today. But before that – I have to ask an important question: Neil, are you <strong>a cat person</strong> or <strong>a dog person</strong>?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Oh, that's easy – I'm <strong>a cat person</strong>, for sure. Dogs are just a… well, they are hard work, aren't they?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>If you say you are '<strong>a cat person</strong>' it means you prefer cats. '<strong>A coffee person</strong>' prefers coffee. A 'something' person likes or prefers that thing, often over another thing.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Back to the topic, I'm <strong>a cat person</strong>. But can you answer this, Dan? Recently, a cat called Omar made headlines for being, possibly, the world's longest cat. How long is Omar? Is it…</p><p>a) 120 cm</p><p>b) 80 cm</p><p>Or c) 180 cm</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>I'm gonna say c) 180 cm.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Now, from long cats to long-distance cats. Scientists were <strong>scratching their heads</strong> a couple of years ago when a lost cat called Holly travelled 200 miles to get home. How did it do it?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>We say you '<strong>scratch your head</strong>' when you are confused about something. There are a few theories about how cats and dogs navigate – but we don't yet have the full answer.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, both cats and dogs have an extremely powerful sense of smell, of course. Smells are like signposts – they let you know where you are. Visual <strong>landmarks</strong> also play a role, just as they do with humans. A <strong>landmark</strong> is something very easily recognised – a big building or mountain for example.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>And what about this one: <strong>magnets</strong> are pieces of metal which attract certain other kinds of metal - for example, iron or steel. The Earth itself has a <strong>magnetic</strong> force.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Birds use it to help them navigate over thousands of miles – it tells them where north is. It's thought they have some iron in their beaks.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>But some scientists think mammals also have this capability.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So we have a few ideas – smell, <strong>landmarks</strong>, <strong>magnetic</strong> forces – but can we explain how one kitty travelled over 200 miles by itself back to its home?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Let's hear from cat and dog expert Dr John Bradshaw. How do cats build up the maps in their heads?</p><p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Dr John Bradshaw, School of Veterinary Sciences, University of Bristol<br/></strong>What they do when they are in a new <strong>territory</strong> is explore it in a very <strong>systematic</strong> way. So they will go out in ever-increasing circles, they'll literally construct a mental map in their heads. And so a cat that's lost its territory probably does the same thing. They'll rely on the idea that if they go out in ever-increasing circles or rectangles then eventually they'll either come across the <strong>territory</strong> or they'll come across a smell carried on the wind of the territory that they used to live in and then be able to go home.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Cats have a <strong>systematic</strong> approach – which means they use a <strong>system</strong>. Which is: first they walk around their area in a small circle, then a bigger one and then a bigger one – until they have a strong mental map of the place.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes – a mental map is a map in your head – stored in your memory. And the area cats explore – their home area - is called their <strong>territory</strong>. Cats are <strong>territorial</strong> – which means their <strong>territory</strong> is very important to them.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Having a map is great, but what happens when a cat gets lost? Dr Bradshaw says that again, it moves around in bigger and bigger circles, until it finds a clue – which is a <strong>landmark</strong> or a smell – that tells it where it is. Well, that's the theory. Though Dr Bradshaw says we really still don't have enough data – that's enough information about this.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>When there is a scientific breakthrough - we'll bring it to you in 6 Minute English, I hope. For now, let's content ourselves with Omar, possibly, the world's longest cat. How long, Dan?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>I said 180 cm.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Omar measures 120 cm – that's over two thirds of my height – and weighs a heavy 14 kg.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Well, one thing, Neil, if Omar ever got lost, he'd be found in no time.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>He's a <strong>landmark</strong> in himself! Which reminds me – let's run through today's words again. If you're <strong>a cat person</strong>, you prefer cats. If you're <strong>an evening person</strong> – you prefer evenings.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>I've always thought you were a kind person, Neil.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Nice of you to say, but we only use the phrase with nouns, not adjectives!</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Indeed. We don't want the listeners to be <strong>scratching their heads</strong>.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>No, we can't confuse them! So let's explain the next one clearly – a <strong>landmark</strong> is something easily recognisable that lets you know where you are. The bridges in London are <strong>landmarks</strong>.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>And can we say the parks are <strong>magnets</strong> in summer? A <strong>magnet </strong>is a piece of metal that attracts iron and steel – but we can also use the word more widely to describe things that attract other things. Two more words: <strong>territory</strong> is a noun – the area of land that an animal considers to be its own.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Animals who feel this strongly are described as <strong>territorial</strong>. Humans can be too – about land or subjects they feel they own or control.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>And finally <strong>systematic</strong>: the adjective from system. We can talk about a <strong>systematic</strong> approach, a <strong>systematic</strong> solution, a <strong>systematic</strong> study…</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And we have <strong>systematically</strong> worked our way through all of today's words!</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Very good! Which means – it's time mention our own online <strong>territory</strong> – our website and social media pages.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Check us out on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube, and of course bbclearningenglish.com!</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Bye bye for now.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Goodbye!</p>",Transcript,<p><strong>a (cat) person</strong> <br/> someone who likes or prefers (cats)</p><p><strong>to scratch your head (about something)<br/></strong>to be confused (about something)</p><p><strong>landmark<br/></strong>something which is easily recognisable and helps you find your way</p><p><strong>magnet<br/></strong>a piece of metal which attracts certain metals</p><p><strong>systematic<br/></strong>done according to a system</p><p><strong>territory<br/></strong>the area an animal controls</p>,Vocabulary

Why is it so successful? Rob and Neil improve themselves and teach you six items of useful vocabulary in this episode of 6 Minute English., 06 Jul 2017,"<p><em>Note: This is not a word for word transcript</em></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Neil, and today we're going to improve ourselves.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Haha, how could we possibly get any better? I'm Rob, and yes, today's topic is <strong>self-help</strong> – and the <strong>self-help</strong> industry.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>What do we mean by <strong>self-help</strong>? Well, it means trying to improve yourself – psychologically, economically or in other ways – without seeking official help.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>For example, bookshops these days are full of titles which claim to boost your self-confidence, your wealth, your love life… or your career!</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, in just seven days! There's a clear demand for this kind of thing – the <strong>self-help</strong> industry is worth $10bn in the US alone.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>That's a lot. That includes things like gym memberships, diet plans and life coaching apps.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>We'll be looking at why. But first, the <strong>self-help</strong> industry has been around for a long time. Which of these well-known books was published first?</p><p>a) How to Win Friends and Influence People</p><p>b) Think and Grow Rich</p><p>c) The Law of Attraction</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Mmm... I could do with some help here. I'll go with the first one – How to Win Friends and Influence People.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>OK, well before we go further, let's take a trip inside a bookshop in Manchester to find out which <strong>self-help</strong> books are selling well.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Let's listen to Emma Marshall, a manager at Waterstones bookshop. What's popular now?</p><p><strong>Emma Marshall, Assistant Manager, Waterstones<br/></strong>At the moment we're in the tidying up, getting rid of things <strong>trend</strong>. But before that we saw colouring in, which became a huge thing. It's kind of <strong>dwindling</strong> now, because these sorts of <strong>trends</strong> come in and then they go. Like last year we saw 'hygge', which is the Danish art of living well, apparently. So we're taking from all sorts of cultures. And so I think the <strong>trend</strong> right now is about slowing down in your life.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Emma says there are a couple of <strong>trends</strong> right now. A <strong>trend</strong>, here, means something new which is popular for a period of time.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes, so she mentioned tidying up and getting rid of things. Would you buy a book about tidying up, Neil?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I'd be more likely to buy a book about it than actually tidy up! She also mentioned a current trend about slowing down in our lives.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>I can agree with that! And previous <strong>trends</strong> included colouring-in – these books have black and white outline pictures that you fill in with colours.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I used to do that as a child. Very <strong>therapeutic</strong>!</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong><strong>Therapeutic</strong> – making you feel more relaxed and less anxious – it's related to the word therapy…</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Although the colouring-in <strong>trend</strong> is <strong>dwindling </strong>- it's becoming weaker. They're selling fewer colouring-in books.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>So – <strong>trends</strong> come and go, but the industry is <strong>going from strength to strength</strong>.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong><strong>To go from strength to strength</strong> means to remain strong, or get even stronger! Why?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Dr Jennifer Wild, a psychologist from Oxford University, believes that the internet is a big factor.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>We've got used to searching for solutions online, and now these solutions even include how to fix or improve our lives.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And psychologist Caroline Beaton, writing on Forbes.com, said she believes that <strong>millennials</strong> are a big factor.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>How do we define the term '<strong>millennial</strong>'? Also known as Generation Y – are people born between the mid-1980s and early 2000s. It's a common term in the news – often because people born in this time in the West are seen to have certain characteristics.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>They're sometimes described as lazy and obsessed with themselves – and while that's not necessarily true, Caroline Beaton says <strong>millennials</strong> are highly self-critical.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Self-critical – they are aware of their own faults – which also means they're more likely to spend time on money on <strong>self-help</strong>. She says they spend twice as much as Generation Xers. Generation X refers to people born between the late 60s and around 1980.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And one more possible reason why the <strong>self-help</strong> industry does well: it's very resistant to recessions. When the economy does badly – as we say it goes into recession – people are perhaps even more likely to reach for <strong>self-help</strong> to improve their situation.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So there we are. Now, let's go back to another recession – the Great Depression of the 1930s in America – and to my question about which <strong>self-help</strong> book was published first?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well – I said a) How to Win Friends and Influence People.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>In fact – two of these books were published in the late 1930s, How to win friends and influence people, by Dale Carnegie, was first in 1936. It has since sold over 30 million copies. Think and grow rich, by Napoleon Hill, was published in 1937, and is believed to have sold over 100 million copies!</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>That's a lot of self-help. Wow – have you read either of them?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I haven't read either of them but, perhaps, I should</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well, before we rush home and improve ourselves, let's improve our vocabularies.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Of course – today we had: <strong>self-help</strong> - the activity of improving yourself – physically, mentally or in other ways – often through courses and books.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>There are lots of <strong>trends</strong> in the <strong>self-help</strong> industry. And we also see <strong>trends</strong> in fashion, in music, in popular culture… Like the <strong>trend</strong> for men to grow beards.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Are you talking about me? Anyway, I think the beard trend is <strong>dwindling</strong>. It's getting smaller, less influential.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Really? I stroke my beard here. I think it's very <strong>therapeutic</strong>. It makes me relax and feel good.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Maybe you're right. What about our next phrase – to <strong>go from strength to strength</strong>?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>You could say a business is <strong>going from strength to strength</strong> if it's earning a lot of money.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Indeed. And what about our term for young people – <strong>millennial</strong>. Are you a <strong>millennial</strong>, Rob?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Didn't quite scraped in there. I'm still a Generation X. But I do like to think I'm in touch with what <strong>millennials</strong> do. Which includes – having lots of different social media accounts.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Just like us – do look up BBC Learning English on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And good luck with your self-improvement!</p><p><strong>Both<br/></strong>Bye!</p>",Transcript,<p><strong>self-help</strong> <br/> trying to improve yourself without the help of professionals</p><p><strong>trend<br/></strong>something new which is popular for a period</p><p><strong>to dwindle<br/></strong>to become fewer or weaker</p><p><strong>therapeutic<br/></strong>relaxing; making you feel less anxious</p><p><strong>to go from strength to strength<br/></strong>to become more successful over time</p><p><strong>millennial<br/></strong>someone born between the mid-1980s and early 2000s</p>,Vocabulary

Today we're talking about <strong>first impressions</strong> – and how they're often wrong.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So let's start with the term <strong>first impression </strong>– it's the idea or opinion you have about someone after meeting them for only a short time.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>It's very natural to make a quick judgement about someone based on their appearance or facial expression. </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>We're going to be hearing about the research of Professor Alexander Todorov from Princeton University in the US. First, a question: how long does he say it takes to form an impression about someone's face? Is it...</p><p>a) under one second</p><p>b) one second</p><p>c) six seconds</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>I'll go for b) one second.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, we'll find out if you're right or not at the end of the programme.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>So – Alexander Todorov has been researching our impressions. His tests asked people to decide whether they thought faces were dominant, competent, <strong>trustworthy</strong> or <strong>extroverted</strong>.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Let's just look at those words for a second. Dominant means being strongest or most important. Competent means being able to do things.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>While if you're <strong>trustworthy</strong> it means people trust you – you are worth their trust. And being extroverted means you are energetic and enjoy spending time with others.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So what did he find out? Faces that look happy and feminine – like a woman - were rated as more <strong>trustworthy</strong>.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>While faces that were more masculine – like a man – were seen as more dominant.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Wider faces with big eyes were seen as more <strong>extroverted</strong>.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Now the important thing that Todorov says is that these judgements <em>aren't</em> accurate. Someone who looks competent isn't necessarily competent!</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So, what does this mean in practice? Here's Professor Todorov:</p><p><strong>Professor Alexander Todorov, Princeton University<br/></strong><strong>Trustworthiness</strong>, dominance and attractiveness are the three big things that we form impressions of people. But interestingly we have done some work predicting the electoral success of politicians, and the judgement that is most predictive of who is going to win the election is <strong>perceived</strong> competence. And this is not random at all, because if you ask voters what is the most important <strong>attribute</strong> of a politician, competence is the one on the top. </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>OK, so this is actually quite significant. People say that the most important <strong>attribute</strong> – or quality – for a politician is competence – the ability to do things.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>That sounds fair enough. But because we make judgements based on appearance – this can actually affect how people vote.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>If voters believe – or <strong>perceive</strong> someone to be competent – they're more likely to vote for him or her.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>He says this applies especially to people who are less educated about politics – they are more likely to be influenced by appearance.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>He says this applies to around 25% of voters – so the number of people who <strong>go with their gut</strong> is large enough to influence the outcomes of elections!</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Wow. <strong>To go with</strong> <strong>your gut</strong>. That means to make a decision which isn't based on rational thought – it's based on instinct, on a feeling, on your gut.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes – your gut is your stomach and the organs in your belly. So, can we tell nothing from a person's face?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Todorov says faces carry useful information about things like a person's mental state, and whether they're tired or sick. But they don't tell you about a person's character.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Indeed. It's not only elections where this counts, we also judge during job interviews and meetings.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>So what can we do to minimise the chances of being affected – should we just close our eyes when we meet people?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, it's not such a bad idea! There's the example of the Boston Symphony Orchestra – back in the 1950s it was entirely made up of male musicians. They then introduced 'blind auditions' in other words they listened to new musicians without looking at them.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And what happened – I guess many more women were selected?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Exactly – around 50%. Of course, gender and race are also huge factors in how we perceive faces. Todorov says we tend to react most positively to faces that look like our own.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Right, well – I guess we just need to take a deep breath and try not to judge too much.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Easier said than done, I'm afraid. Especially when we judge so quickly! But do we do it in under a second, one second or six seconds?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>I said one second.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>According to Todorov it takes under one second.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>I think it's safe to say it's very fast. So shall we <em>quickly</em> go through today's vocabulary?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Ok – first up: <strong>first impression</strong> – the first judgement you make about something. What was your <strong>first impression</strong> of me, Rob?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well I thought you were very <strong>trustworthy</strong> and <strong>extroverted.</strong></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well isn't that convenient, (and accurate?!), because those were exactly the two adjectives I wanted to look at next. Being <strong>trustworthy</strong> is important in life – it means people trust you…</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And being <strong>extroverted</strong> is more of a character type – <strong>extroverts</strong> like to be with people, and are often seen as confident – whereas the opposite – introverts, usually need to spend time on their own, and aren't as loud.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Both of these are interesting <strong>attributes </strong>– or qualities. You could say that mathematical ability is an essential <strong>attribute</strong> for an engineer.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And competence is the number one attribute for a politician. Although people don't always vote depending on actual competence, they base it on their <strong>perception</strong>.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>What they see, or <strong>perceive</strong>, as competence. '<strong>Perceived</strong> competence' might be different from actual competence!</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes, in many situations we tend to <strong>go with our guts</strong>. We make decisions based on deep feelings. Do you do that, Neil?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, some things you can think about too much. When I left my last job, I really just <strong>went with my gut </strong>– it felt like the right thing to do.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Of course – because it meant coming to work here with me!</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Naturally. So – that's it for our chat about first impressions – for more do visit our Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube pages, and of course our website!</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Bye for now.</p><p><strong>Both<br/></strong>Bye!</p>",Transcript,<p><strong>first impression</strong><br/> the idea or opinion of someone or something you make after a very short time</p><p><strong>trustworthy<br/></strong>able to be trusted</p><p><strong>extroverted<br/></strong>(of a person) happy and enjoying being with others</p><p><strong>attributes<br/></strong>qualities</p><p><strong>perception<br/></strong>opinion based on how things appear</p><p><strong>to go with your gut<br/></strong>make a decision based on feelings</p>,Vocabulary

I'm Catherine.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And I'm Neil. Today – is technology built to fail? And are we throwing away too much technology and harming the planet? Catherine, tell me - how old is your TV?</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>My TV has just had its fifth birthday.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And your mobile phone?</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>It's about two and a half.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>So you do like to have<strong> gizmos</strong></span><span>, but not necessarily the latest.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Exactly.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><strong><span>Gizmo</span></strong><span> – nice word. A <strong>gizmo</strong></span><span> is a small piece of technology – otherwise called a gadget.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span><span> </span></strong><span>And of course I'm not alone in buying gadgets from time to time. They actually keep on getting more advanced – so people keep buying new ones.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Technology also gets cheaper and cheaper. In fact, many gadgets are more expensive to fix than replace.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And this means that we throw a lot of gadgets away – but how many?</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>See if you can guess: how much electronic waste is thrown away every year globally? Is it…<br/></span><span> a) 420 tonnes,<br/></span><span>b) 4.2 million tonnes or<br/></span><span>c) 42 million tonnes?</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And I do actually know the answer to this once, so I'm gonna keep quiet, just for once!</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Ah, first time for everything! So, to bring us back to our main point. Is technology no longer built to last? Let's hear first from Professor Tim Cooper who is an expert in <strong>sustainable</strong></span><span> consumption and production at Nottingham Trent University in the UK.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span><strong>Sustainable</strong>, by the way, means 'able to continue over a long period of time'. We often use it to mean 'able to continue without causing harm' – like environmental damage. What's the problem with mobile phones?</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>INSERT<br/></span></strong><strong><span>Tim Cooper, Professor of Sustainable Consumption and Production at Nottingham Trent University<br/></span></strong><span>The classic example of this is the mobile phone, where, for example, screens are glued into the product. Now they know that if there was a <strong>screw</strong></span><span> there, the consumer could easily, when that screen cracks, which is obviously a very common problem with mobile phones, </span><strong><span>unscrew</span></strong><span> it and put a new screen on. They don't. They know perfectly well that that would be a way in which mobile phones would last longer. They don't want that, they want you to replace your mobile phone every year or two.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Professor Cooper says that mobile phones' screens crack often – and generally when that happens people buy a new one.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>That's partly because mobile phones' screens are glued on rather than <strong>screwed</strong></span><span> on. Now a </span><strong><span>screw</span></strong><span> is a piece of metal like a nail but with a raised twisted part – and we use screws to join two things together.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>The verb form is the same – to <strong>screw</strong></span><span> – and the opposite is to </span><strong><span>unscrew</span></strong><span>. If you could </span><strong><span>unscrew</span></strong><span> a cracked screen and then replace it, there'd be no need to buy a whole new phone, he says.<br/><br/></span><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>He thinks that generally, people have <strong>lowered their expectations</strong></span><span> when it comes to how long things should last.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><strong><span>Expectations</span></strong><span> is a good word – an <strong>expectation</strong></span><span> is a strong belief something will happen. </span><strong><span>Expectations</span></strong><span> can be raised or </span><strong><span>lowered</span></strong><span>.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Or managed – to 'manage your<strong> expectations</strong></span><span>' means to not let your expectations get so high that you then become disappointed when something fails.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, by way of an example, Professor Cooper says that his parents' washing machine lasted for 37 years. These days, they last between five and ten.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Yeah. And we don't see electrical products as an investment in the same way that people used to. We now worry that what we buy today will become <strong>obsolete </strong></span><span>tomorrow.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span><strong>Obsolete</strong> – no longer valid or useful. And also – he says we've become so used to cheap products that we don't want to spend more on good quality.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>So what's to be done?</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Cooper suggests that if we can afford it, we really should try to buy higher quality products. And manufacturers should put labels on their products saying how long they are designed to last.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>An interesting idea. Cooper says that over 2m pounds worth of electrical goods are thrown away each year in the UK. He calls it a ""<strong>throwaway culture""</strong></span><span>.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>A culture in which we throw things out much more easily. Not good for the planet either. So – will you try to keep your mobile for a bit longer, or are you already tempted by the latest model, Catherine?</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>I'm happy with the one I've got, but I'm gonna protect the screen very carefully.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, a good idea. Maybe this will help you make up your mind, though. I asked how many tonnes of electrical waste are thrown away globally.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And I said I know the answer – it's actually 42m tonnes, according to a UN report back in 2015. The figure could be a lot higher now. And as you know – my mobile isn't very heavy – so 42m tonnes is an awful lot of phones! While we try to picture that, let's quickly run through today's vocabulary. So first up was <strong>gizmo</strong></span><span> - a small piece of technology – a gadget.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Smartphones, smart watches, fitness trackers, sat navs – all <strong>gizmos</strong></span><span>!</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>We had <strong>sustainable</strong></span><span> – able to last or continue. We talk about </span><strong><span>sustainable</span></strong><span> energy, </span><strong><span>sustainable</span></strong><span> economic development…</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>The opposite would be <strong>unsustainable </strong></span><span>development… And another pair of words – to </span><strong><span>screw</span></strong><span> and to </span><strong><span>unscrew</span></strong><span>.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>A <strong>screw </strong></span><span>is that little metal thing like a nail that we use to join things together. You can </span><strong><span>screw </span></strong><span>shelves into the wall, you can </span><strong><span>screw</span></strong><span> </span><span>furniture </span><span>together…</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And when you move house you <strong>unscrew </strong></span><span>it. Three more: to </span><strong><span>lower your expectations</span></strong><span>. What have you lowered your expectations about?</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Catherine</span></strong><br/><span> Err, so many things… Becoming a millionaire - I don't think that's going to happen. Or I could say a company has lowered its </span><strong><span>expectations</span></strong><span> about performance over the next five years.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yes – another one looking ahead into the future – I'm pretty sure my computer will be <strong>obsolete</strong></span><span> in ten years. It will no longer be used – it will be out of date.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>I just urge you, Neil, when you do get a new one – please recycle this one responsibly. We already live in a <strong>throwaway culture</strong></span><span>.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yes – it's pretty <strong>unsustainable</strong></span><span>.

", 15 Jun 2017,"<p><span> </span><em>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript</em><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>OK, I want you to close your eyes. Focus… on your breathing.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Er, Neil? Can we do this later? We've only got six minutes.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Ok, Catherine. Welcome to a <strong>mindful</strong></span><span> edition of 6 Minute English, where we're exploring the rise of </span><strong><span>mindfulness</span></strong><span> – particularly in schools.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And we'll be teaching six items of vocabulary along the way. So I think we should start with <strong>mindfulness</strong></span><span> itself.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Being <strong>mindful</strong></span><span>, as an adjective, means 'being calmly aware of everything in your body and mind'. You only focus on 'now'.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>People practise <strong>mindfulness</strong></span><span>, the noun, by focusing only on their breath, and not allowing themselves to be distracted by passing thoughts.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Indeed. It's traditionally associated with Buddhism, and has become incredibly popular in the <strong>secular</strong></span><span> world – in workplaces, in private classes and even in schools.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span><span> Secular </span></strong><span>means 'non-religious' by the way.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>OK, I just mentioned schools: how many teachers in the UK are trained to teach <strong>mindfulness</strong></span><span>? Is it…<br/></span><span>a) 500,<br/></span><span>b) 5,000 or<br/></span><span>c) 50,000?</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span><span> </span></strong><span>Let me focus really hard – I think it's 5,000.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span><span> </span></strong><span>A very <strong>mindful</strong></span><span> answer, Catherine. But I'll reveal the real answer later. Now let's hear from one teacher who's been </span><span>practising <strong>mindfulness </strong><span></span>with students for many years. Alison Mayo, Head of Early Years at Dharma Primary School, thinks it's particularly suited to young children. Why?</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>INSERT<br/></span></strong><strong><span>Alison Mayo, Head of Early Years, Dharma Primary School<br/></span></strong><span>That</span><span>'s very natural for children - to be <strong>in the present</strong></span><span>. And we really kind of celebrate that because that is a place where they are learning. So, if they feel </span><strong><span>grounded</span></strong>,<span> then they can really develop their concentration and their focus, and relax. Learning happens so much more easily if you're relaxed and happy.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Alison said it was natural for children to be <strong>in the present</strong></span><span>.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><strong><span>The present</span></strong><span> – means 'now'. You'll know it from the 'present tense' in grammar. And people who practise <strong>mindfulness</strong></span><span> use this phrase a lot – to be </span><strong><span>in the present</span></strong><span>, or </span><strong><span>in the present moment</span></strong><span>.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>It sounds simple, but actually it's very hard to achieve.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Well, Neil, it might be for an old chap like you, but for young people, Miss Mayo thinks it's very natural.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Fair enough. Being <strong>grounded</strong></span><span>, as she says, helps students concentrate and learn in a relaxed way.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span><strong>Grounded</strong> is another good adjective there – it means 'rational, sensible, clear thinking'.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>So, she's a fan of <strong>mindfulness</strong></span><span>. And there's growing evidence behind its benefits.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Yes. The UK's national health advisory body has recommended it to help treat conditions like depression and anxiety.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Studies have shown it reduces levels of the stress hormone, cortisol.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And a new study has claimed that eating <strong>mindfully</strong></span><span> can actually help people to lose weight.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>You mean eating slowly?</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Yeah, slowly and really experiencing and tasting the food. Not being distracted and not eating too much too fast! Anyway, Neil, is <strong>mindfulness</strong></span><span> taking over the world?</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, not quite yet. There still aren't many detailed studies on it – and some critics say the studies we have show a publication <strong>bias</strong></span><span>. In other words, only the positive results are published.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>A <strong>bias</strong></span><span> is when you support something or someone in an unfair way, because of your preferences or beliefs.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>What seems certain is that <strong>mindfulness</strong></span><span> has entered into many aspects of modern life, at least here in the UK. Now, let's look back at our question. I asked how many teachers in the UK have been trained in </span><strong><span>mindfulness</span></strong><span>.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And I said 5,000.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, it was actually 5,000. Well done! According to the <strong>Mindfulness</strong></span><span> Initiative. And it keeps on growing.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>So before we finish up, here's another question that might be useful for our listeners – what's the difference between <strong>mindfulness</strong></span><span> and </span><strong><span>meditation</span></strong><span>?</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Aha – that's not so easy to define. <strong>Meditation</strong></span><span> is the broader term. When you </span><strong><span>meditate</span></strong><span> you spend time quietly – focusing your mind - often for relaxation or spiritual purposes. </span><strong><span>Mindfulness</span></strong><span> is a particular a kind of </span><strong><span>meditation</span></strong><span> – when you try to empty your mind of thought. Does that make sense?</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Yeah, more or less. So we'll let our listeners <strong>meditate</strong></span><span> on that answer. And before we empty our minds, let's look back at today's words. We had </span><strong><span>mindfulness</span></strong><span>, </span><strong><span>mindful</span></strong><span> and </span><strong><span>mindfully</span></strong><span> – they all relate to the particular practice of being only focused of what's happening now.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>What's happening now, or we could say – what's happening <strong>in the present</strong></span><span>.

And they teach you six items of useful vocabulary", 08 Jun 2017,"<p><em>Note: This is not a word for word transcript</em></p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English– the show that brings you an interesting topic, authentic listening practice and six new items of vocabulary. I'm Dan…</p><p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>And I'm Neil. In this episode we'll be discussing if happiness is genetic<br/> <br/> <strong>Dan</strong><br/> How happy would you say you are Neil? <br/> <strong><br/> Neil</strong> <br/> I’m pretty happy I think. Why do you ask?<br/> <br/> <strong>Dan</strong><br/> Well, in March this year the UN published its fifth world happiness report.<strong><br/> <br/> Neil<br/> </strong>Is that the one that ranks all of the countries based on how happy they are? <br/> <strong><br/> Dan<br/> </strong>You've heard of it then. Over all there are 155 countries included, and Norway came top of them all, overtaking Denmark, which was the leader for the years 2012 to 2016.<br/> <br/> <strong>Neil<br/> </strong>Well what about the UK?<strong><br/> <br/> Dan<br/> </strong>Ah, well that’s this week’s questions, isn’t it? Where did the UK place?<br/> <br/> a) in the top 10<br/> b) between 11th and 20th<br/>c) after 21st</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/> Well, I’m going to say c) after 21st</p><p><strong>Dan<br/> </strong>Ok, you know the drill. No answers until the end of the show.<br/> <br/> <strong>Neil<br/> </strong>So, Norway, eh? And Denmark the previous year? They’re neighbours!<br/> <br/> <strong>Dan<br/> </strong>Yes. In fact, for the last 5 years, the results have been pretty much the same. Nordic countries tend to <strong>dominate</strong> the top of the table.<br/> <br/> <strong>Neil</strong><br/> <strong>Dominate</strong> meaning 'control'. Ok, well how are the results decided? <br/> <br/> <strong>Dan</strong><br/> It’s very simple. They ask 1000 people in each country a single <strong>subjective</strong> question.<br/> <br/> <strong>Neil</strong><br/> <strong>Subjective</strong> means 'based on personal experience, beliefs or feelings'. …Well, what’s the question?<br/> <br/> <strong>Dan<br/> </strong>Imagine a ladder, with steps numbered from 0 at the bottom to 10 at the top. The top of the ladder represents the best possible life for you and the bottom of the ladder represents the worst possible life for you. On which step of the ladder would you say you personally feel you stand at this time?<br/> <br/> <strong>Neil<br/> </strong>That’s actually quite simple.<br/> <br/> <strong>Dan<br/> </strong>Yep. The Nordic countries all score an average close to 7.5 out of 10.<br/> <br/> <strong>Neil<br/> </strong>So we have a number of neighbouring countries which all claim to be extremely happy. There must be a connection….is it the weather?<br/> <br/> <strong>Dan<br/> </strong>Well, that’s a logical conclusion, but there is another idea. I’ll let Professor Andrew Oswald from the University of Warwick explain.<br/> <br/><strong>INSERT <br/> Professor Andrew Oswald, University of Warwick<br/> </strong>We think that there is a genetic <strong>component</strong>, in part, to why the Danes do so well coming so regularly at the head of happiness international league tables. It does appear from the data that the Danes have the smallest amount of the, you might say, dangerous, short kind of genetic pattern. So they may have a kind of <strong>inoculation</strong> against the possibility of depression. <strong><br/> </strong><br/> <strong>Neil<br/> </strong>So, professor Oswald mentioned there is a genetic <strong>component,</strong> or part, to Danish DNA which gives them an <strong>inoculation</strong>, or illness protection, against depression and sadness. <br/> <br/> <strong>Dan<br/> </strong>Yep. All of the Nordic countries have a similar make-up.<br/> <br/> <strong>Neil<br/> </strong>But he said ‘in part’. That means it doesn’t explain everything. So, there’s something missing. <br/> <br/> <strong>Dan<br/> </strong>There’s no fooling you! Michael Booth has written a book about Nordic happiness. He has another theory.<br/> <br/> <strong>INSERT<br/> Michael Booth, Author<br/> </strong>There are so many reasons why the Danes are happy, why they’re <strong>content </strong>that have nothing to do with DNA. Of course they’re happy! They’re rich! They’re sexy! They’re funny! They don’t work that much!</p><p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>Ah. So being rich, funny, sexy and not working much is why they are <strong>content</strong>, meaning 'satisfied'. That sounds a bit like you, Dan.<br/> <br/> <strong>Dan<br/> </strong>I can’t publicly comment on that Neil, I’m sorry! But there is one more piece we’re missing. Hygge. It’s a loanword and only just appeared in the British dictionaries. We don’t have a direct translation, but it basically means <strong>cosiness</strong>.<br/> <br/> <strong>Neil<br/> Cosiness</strong>, meaning 'warm, comfortable and safe'.<br/> <br/> <strong>Dan<br/> </strong>Yes. Danes love simple comforts. A warm <strong>cosy</strong> room, some drinks, some candles and a fire, and they are happy. Maybe that’s the secret.<br/> <br/><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>Well, the secret to my happiness right now is finding out if I was right in the quiz.<br/> <br/> <strong>Dan<br/> </strong>Oh yes! I asked: Where did the UK place in the World Happiness Report 2017<br/> a) in the top 10<br/> b) between 11th and 20th<br/>c) after 21st</p><p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>I said c) after 21st</p><p><strong>Dan<br/> </strong>And I’m afraid you’re wrong my friend. We placed b) between 11th and  20th. We were actually 19th. </p><p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>Well, let’s make our listeners happy by going through the vocabulary.<br/> <br/> <strong>Dan<br/> </strong>Ok. First we had <strong>dominate</strong>. If you <strong>dominate</strong> something or someone, you control it. It’s quite an aggressive word. You wouldn’t use it for people much. But, give us an example, Neil.<br/> <br/> <strong>Neil<br/> </strong>You can talk about a team <strong>dominating</strong> play in a sport. Next we had <strong>subjective</strong>. If something is <strong>subjective </strong>it is based on personal experience, beliefs or feelings rather than facts, which are objective. What type of things are <strong>subjective</strong>, Dan?<br/> <br/> <strong>Dan<br/> </strong>Oh, it’s our opinions of art, music, jokes, food. You know, I like sausages and ice-cream but no one else does! <br/> <br/> <strong>Neil</strong><br/> That’s because it’s disgusting!<br/> <br/> <strong>Dan</strong><br/> Then we had <strong>component</strong>. A <strong>component</strong> is part of something that makes up a larger whole. Televisions and computers have many <strong>components</strong> in them. <br/> <br/> <strong>Neil<br/> </strong>And a person can be an essential <strong>component</strong> in a team, like a goal-keeper in football. After that was <strong>inoculation</strong>. An <strong>inoculation</strong> is a form of disease protection. It is a synonym of….Dan?<br/> <br/><strong>Dan<br/> </strong>Vaccination. I went on holiday last year and had to have my <strong>inoculations</strong> updated. Then we had <strong>content</strong>.If you are <strong>content</strong>, you are satisfied and want nothing. What makes you content, Neil?<br/> <br/> <strong>Neil<br/> </strong>A warm sunny day in my garden with a good book. And finally we had <strong>cosiness</strong>. <strong>Cosiness</strong> comes from <strong>cosy</strong>, which means 'warm, comfortable and safe'. Where’s <strong>cosy </strong>for you Dan?<br/> <br/> <strong>Dan<br/> </strong>Oh easy. On a freezing cold day, it’s tucked up in bed with a nice cup of tea. And that’s the end of today's 6 Minute English. Please join us again soon!<br/> <br/> <strong>Neil<br/> </strong>And we are on social media too, of course - Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube. See you there.<br/> <br/> <strong>Both<br/> </strong>Bye!</p>",Transcript,"<p><strong>dominate<br/></strong>control</p><p><strong>subjective</strong><br/> based on personal experience, beliefs or feelings rather than fact</p><p><strong>component</strong><br/>a part of something making up a larger whole</p><p><strong>inoculation<br/></strong>a form of disease protection</p><p><strong>content<br/></strong>satisfied and wanting nothing</p><p><strong>cosiness</strong><br/> a feeling of being warm comfortable and safe</p>",Vocabulary

And they teach you six items of useful vocabulary", 01 Jun 2017,"<p><em>Note: This is not a word for word transcript</em></p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English – the show that brings you an interesting topic, authentic listening practice and six new items of vocabulary. I'm Dan…</p><p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>And I'm Neil. In this episode we'll be discussing water burial.</p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/> Yes. It’s a bit of a <strong>bleak</strong> subject, I’m afraid.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong> <br/> Something which is <strong>bleak</strong> is unpleasant or without hope.</p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/> And, do you know what’s really <strong>bleak</strong>? It’s this week's question. On average, how many people die each hour?</p><p>a) six thousand</p><p>b) sixty thousand</p><p>c) six hundred thousand</p><p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>I am going to guess b) sixty thousand</p><p><strong>Dan<br/> </strong>And we'll find out if you're right or not at the end of this show. So, the actual figure is 55m people each year. Now, religious or not, there is a practical issue to be dealt with, which is, Neil?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>What to do with the body?<br/> <br/><strong>Dan<br/> </strong>Exactly! So what are the options for the average person?</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/> Well, there’s burial, or there’s cremation.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/> </strong>Burial is when a body is put into the earth and cremation is when a body is burnt. But there are big problems with both. For example, what two things do most people need in order to be buried?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>Well, a coffin – or a box to put the body in and a <strong>grave</strong>. That’s the place the coffin and body go into.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/> </strong>Exactly, but coffins are most often made of wood. In the US they use four million acres of forest every year just to make coffins. And as for <strong>graves</strong>, cemeteries are beginning to get overcrowded – there’s no space left! After all, dying is not exactly a new thing! It’s been happening for years.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/> Aha, but with <strong>cremation,</strong> there’s no space needed. And they burn gas to dispose of the body. That’s got to be better.<br/> <br/> <strong>Dan</strong><br/> You’d think so, but no. I’ll let Sahar Zand, reporter for the BBC, explain why.</p><p><strong>INSERT <br/> Sahar Zand, BBC reporter<br/> </strong>During the process, a number of <strong>toxins</strong> can be emitted into our environment, including mercury from dental fillings. Cremation also has a carbon cost. With the energy used to process one body, you could actually heat a home for the best part of a week in winter</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/> So cremation can release <strong>toxins</strong>, or poisons, into the environment and it comes with a very high energy cost – enough to heat a home for almost a week! OK. I can see a smug look in your eye, Dan. What do you have up your sleeve?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/> </strong>It’s the latest thing. Water burial.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>Water burial?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/> </strong>This is where the body is put into an alkali solution and heated to 150 degrees centigrade. This breaks down the tissue and leaves only the skeleton.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>Interesting.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/> </strong>Yes! It has huge advantages over cremation</p><p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>Such as?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/> </strong>Well for one thing, it takes only 4 hours to finish. It follows the same process as when a body <strong>decomposes</strong>, but quicker.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>When something <strong>decomposes</strong> it breaks down and decays. Ok, anything else?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/> </strong>It uses much less energy. Each body is weighed and then the computer calculates exactly how much of everything is needed.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>Ok, it’s more efficient too. Why are you smiling?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/> </strong>This is the best part! Listen to Sahar again.</p><p><strong>INSERT<br/> Sahar Zand, BBC reporter</strong><br/> All that’s left at this point is a <strong>brittle</strong> skeleton and any artificial <strong>implants</strong> that they may have had in their body – and they come out almost as good as new. There’s even talk of sending the implants to the developing world, where they can benefit populations that don’t have access to them, because they’re very expensive.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>So after the process you have a <strong>brittle, </strong>or easy to break, skeleton and any <strong>implants</strong> that they had inside them.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/> Implants </strong>are artificial additions to the body, such as plastic hips or an artificial heart. And they’re clean! They can be recycled and given to someone who needs them! Isn’t that cool?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>So, what happens to the skeleton?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/> </strong>It gets ground up into dust and put in a jar to give to the family – exactly the same as a traditional cremation. I love it! Sign me up! Would you like to give it a shot?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>Well, I can’t answer that question. But can I have the answer to our quiz question?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/> </strong>Of course. I asked: On average, how many people die each hour?</p><p>a) six thousand</p><p>b) sixty thousand</p><p>c) six hundred thousand</p><p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>I said b) sixty thousand</p><p><strong>Dan<br/> </strong>And you, my friend, are dead in the water. Unfortunately, it’s a) six thousand</p><p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>Ok. Well that’s probably better, isn’t it?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/> </strong>Yes.<br/> <br/> <strong>Neil</strong><br/> Shall we have a look at the vocabulary then?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/> </strong>Certainly. Our first word was <strong>bleak</strong> meaning something unhappy, unpleasant or without hope. What types of things do we typically describe as bleak, Neil?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>Oh, the weather in the UK can be bleak. It’s very, very dark in the winter. Next we had <strong>grave</strong>. A grave is a hole in the earth where a body is placed. However, there is another use.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/> </strong>Yes. We can talk about a situation being <strong>grave</strong>. The outbreak of war is a very grave situation for many people. Then we had <strong>toxin</strong>. A <strong>toxin</strong> is a substance which is poisonous. Have you ever been poisoned by a toxin, Neil?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>Well, I suppose so, yes. I’ve had food poisoning and that’s caused by <strong>toxins</strong>.  After that was <strong>decompose</strong>. When something <strong>decomposes</strong>, it breaks down and decays. Much like when fruit goes bad and turns black and then becomes liquid.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/> </strong>Then we had <strong>brittle</strong>. Something which is <strong>brittle</strong> is easily broken. For example, Neil?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>Glass, crockery, tiles and some plastic. Crisps! And finally we had <strong>implant</strong>. An <strong>implant</strong> is something artificial which has been put into the body – such as an artificial heart or a replacement hip. Would you like to have any implants, Dan?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/> </strong>I’d quite like robotic legs. Then I could run faster than anyone!</p><p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>Well, we’ve run out of time, so that’s the end of today's 6 Minute English.

They also teach you six items of useful vocabulary.", 25 May 2017,"<p>Note: This is not a word for word transcript</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English – the programme where we bring you an interesting topic and six items of vocabulary. I'm Neil. </p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And I'm Catherine. </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Now, if you want to fight climate change – what can you do?</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Well, you can use less electricity…</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Or stop driving… </p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>But scientists believe there's another behaviour which has an even bigger impact on the planet, and that is what you eat. </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>We're talking about meat here. If people cut out meat and animal products from their diets – harmful <strong>emissions</strong> could be reduced by 70%. That's according to research from Oxford University.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Now<strong> emissions</strong> are the gases produced by an activity or living thing – so we could talk about factory <strong>emissions</strong> or farming <strong>emissions</strong>. </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And if you eat no meat or animal products you're what we call 'vegan'. More and more people around the world are going vegan. And today's question: which of these celebrities is vegan? Is it…<br/>a) Brad Pitt,<br/>b) Jennifer Lopez or<br/>c) Miley Cyrus? </p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And I'm going to go for…c) Miley Cyrus. </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, we'll find out at the end of the programme. Now, before we go much further, why don't we find out a bit more about exactly what it means to be vegan? </p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Here's Tom Kuehnel from the Vegan Society in the UK. </p><p><strong>INSERT<br/> Tom Kuehnel, Vegan Society<br/></strong>Veganism is a way of living which excludes, as far as is possible and practicable, all forms of exploitation and cruelty to animals. So that's for food, clothing or any other purpose. So we just don't want to use or abuse animals. And we feel like there, you know, there are plenty of alternatives <strong>in this day and age</strong>. It's never been easier to be vegan.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Of course, he says that avoiding cruelty to animals is what it's all about, but that doesn't just mean food. If you're a true vegan, then clothing from animals is also out - no more leather shoes! </p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>But he feels that it's easier than ever before to become vegan – and uses a nice phrase: ""<strong>in this day and age</strong>"". </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes. It means 'these days', or 'in the present time' – and is often used to highlight a contrast with a previous time. </p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>So, many people go vegan for <strong>ethical</strong> reasons. Now <strong>ethical</strong> is a useful word, it means 'relating to moral beliefs', so if you become vegan for <strong>ethical</strong> reasons, you do it because you think it's wrong to eat or use animal products. </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Others go vegan because of environmental considerations, as we looked at earlier. Rearing <strong>livestock</strong> – that means animals like cows and pigs – produces a lot of harmful methane gas. Now, let's just say the animals themselves produce a lot of it from their bodies. The other major reason to choose <strong>veganism</strong>… </p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong><strong>Veganism</strong> – now, that's the noun for the diet. </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>… is because they believe it is healthier. </p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>In the research from Oxford University we mentioned earlier, scientists found that 8 million deaths per year could be avoided if the world went vegan. </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Now, that's human deaths. They claim that half of this figure would be because we no longer eat red meat, and the other half would be due to eating more healthy fruit and vegetables – as well as fewer people being overweight. </p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And they say that this would have an economic impact too. They suggest that up to $1,000bn a year would be saved due to reduced healthcare costs and increased productivity at work - because fewer people would get sick. </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So, if it's all so simple – why don't we all go vegan tomorrow? </p><p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/> Well, meat-eating is an important part of most cultures – not everyone wants to change. </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And millions of people worldwide raise <strong>livestock</strong> for a living. </p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>So these jobs would disappear. Now, with up to a third of the planet estimated to be <strong>arid</strong> – which means dry and unable to support crops - people living in these regions rely on <strong>livestock</strong>, so people for example like the Berbers in the Sahara region. </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Without animal farming they would be forced to abandon traditional nomadic lifestyles – that's where they move from place to place - and settle in cities. </p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And for many people, well, they just like eating meat and dairy.<strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>We asked you about well-known vegans: which of these is vegan?<br/>a) Brad Pitt,<br/>b) Jennifer Lopez or<br/>c) Miley Cyrus? </p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And I said it was Miley Cyrus. </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, you're kind of half right, Catherine. In fact, both Brad Pitt and Miley Cyrus are vegan. Jennifer Lopez used to be, but has since started eating meat again, apparently. </p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Now, why don't we wrap up by looking at today's vocabulary one more time? </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well – we started with <strong>emissions</strong>: gases produced by something or an activity such as digestion. Livestock <strong>emissions</strong> for example – are gases produced by animals. </p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>We can also add a word that describes a kind of <strong>emissions</strong>, like methane <strong>emissions</strong> or greenhouse gas <strong>emissions</strong>. </p><p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>Next up we had <strong>in this day and age </strong>– which means 'these days'. </p><p><strong>Catherine<br/> </strong>I still can't believe you still don't have a smartphone in this day and age, Neil. </p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/> Well, maybe I just object to smartphones for <strong>ethical</strong> reasons! </p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>So you have for moral reasons to smartphones? </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yeah, for me it's important to understand the conditions of the workers in the factory where the smartphone is made. </p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>That's fair enough then. But, Neil, you haven't become vegan yet for <strong>ethical</strong> reasons, have you? </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>You've got me there – I admire <strong>veganism</strong> but I still like cheese too much to do it! <strong>Veganism</strong> is the noun.<strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>That's right. So two more words to go – we have <strong>arid</strong> and <strong>livestock</strong>. <strong>Arid</strong> describes land that is too dry to support many crops or plants. </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>But <strong>arid</strong> regions can sometimes support <strong>livestock</strong> – <strong>livestock</strong> means farm animals. If you think of the 'stock' as being the assets of a business, then animals are 'living' or 'live' stock. </p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And that brings us to the end of today's programme.

I'm Neil.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And I'm Catherine. Now, this programme is six minutes long.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yes. It's 6 Minute English!</span></p><p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And we have a challenge for everyone – can you stay focused for the full six minutes?</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Sounds easy? Maybe not, because today we're talking about our <strong>attention spans</strong></span><span>: are they shrinking?</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>That's right, so we're asking today: is the length of time we can focus on something – that's our <strong>attention span</strong></span><span> – actually getting shorter? Now, one study says that – in fact, it claims the human </span><strong><span>attention span</span></strong><span> is now shorter than that of a goldfish.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Can that be true? Smartphones, the internet, social media – these all certainly do take up a lot of our attention. But how much? How long do we look at our mobile phones for in a day, on average? Is it…<br/></span><span>a) around 30 minutes,<br/></span><span>b) around two and a half hours, or<br/></span><span>c) over three hours?</span></p><p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>I tend to be quite busy, but I know some people are really addicted to their mobile phones so I'm going to say around two and a half hours - that's answer 'b'.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>OK, so, a report released by Microsoft said the average human attention span in 2000 was 12 seconds. Since then it's fallen to just eight seconds.</span></p><p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span><span> </span></strong><span>Right, and that's a massive change in a very short time. Now, the year 2000 was just before the boom in digital media and smartphones, so many think they're to blame for all these <strong>distractions</strong></span><span> – now, distractions are things which take away our focus or attention.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yes. And we mentioned goldfish earlier – goldfish reportedly have an <strong>attention span</strong></span><span> of nine seconds. That's one more than phone-obsessed humans with a mere eight seconds!</span></p><p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And there's a phrase in English – we say 'to have the <strong>attention span</strong></span><span> of a goldfish'. Or 'the memory of a goldfish'. So these poor… poor gold goldfish, Neil.</span><span>                                                                                                      </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, they get <strong>a bad press</strong>, don't they? That's a phrase which means 'criticism' – especially criticism in the media and especially in newspapers – or the 'press', as we call it.</span></p><p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>So – is it really true than humans are now even more easily <strong>distracted</strong></span><span> than fish?</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, BBC radio programme More or Less recently investigated this claim.</span></p><p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>That's right. And they found out a couple of things. Firstly – they couldn't find evidence of the research that Microsoft quoted in their report. In other words, the programme couldn't find scientific evidence that our <strong>attention spans</strong></span><span> are in fact shrinking.</span><span>   </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And secondly – the psychologist they spoke to said there are problems with the idea of measuring <strong>attention spans</strong></span><span> in the first place. It's a term that's widely used, but it's not very scientific.</span></p><p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Sounds <strong>fishy</strong></span><span>. </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yes. <strong>Fishy</strong></span><span> means ‘suspicious', by the way. Sorry, goldfish. Again.</span></p><p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>So, are we humans in fact more easily <strong>distracted </strong></span><span>than before? More or Less asked Dr Gemma Briggs, a psychologist at the Open University, if human beings are less able to focus these days.</span></p><p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Dr Gemma Briggs, Psychology lecturer, Open University<br/></strong><span>It's all <strong>down to</strong></span><span> the individual; it's all </span><strong><span>down to</span></strong><span> how you choose to apply your attention. So attention-switching ability may well have developed in recent years, in the age of the smartphone and the internet. But because someone's </span><strong><span>distracted</span></strong><span> by their smartphone or wanting to quickly Google something, it doesn't mean that they then don't have the ability to control and sustain their attention when they carry out another task.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>So she says we're not necessarily more easily <strong>distracted</strong></span><span>. Instead, we may actually be better at switching our attention quickly between different tasks.</span></p><p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>That's right. She's really saying we can <strong>multitask</strong></span><span> better than before. And that means we can focus on many different tasks, each for a shorter period of time. </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>She said: ""It's all <strong>down to</strong></span><span> how you choose to apply your attention."" Let's just highlight that phrase </span><strong><span>down to</span></strong><span>. Here, it means 'depends on'. It all depends on how you choose to apply your attention.</span></p><p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>So – maybe our <strong>attention spans</strong></span><span> aren't getting shorter, we just choose to look at our phones a lot more. </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Which reminds me today's question. I asked you how long on average we spend looking at our phones, and you said?</span></p><p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Well, my <strong>attention span</strong> is not that short that I can't remember that I said two and a half hours.  </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And the answer – if you believe the research – is 2.42 hours per day so, pretty good guess there, Catherine. </span></p><p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Thank you. </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>That comes from Chicago-based research firm Dscout. And what about this: the group they surveyed touched their mobiles over 2,600 times a day. Do you touch your phone 2,600 times a day, Catherine?</span></p><p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>I try not to, what about you?</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>It's probably more than that to be honest. Now, I'm sure everyone wants to get back to touching their phones – or maybe they're even touching them now as they listen – but either way, let's have a review of today's phrases.</span></p><p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>OK, so first we had <strong>attention span</strong></span><span> – that's the length of time we can focus on something.</span><span>  </span><span>And mine is definitely shorter than it used to be… Neil? Neil?</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Sorry – I just got <strong>distracted</strong></span><span> there by a message on my phone. Apologies.</span></p><p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>That's alright. So, next up we had <strong>a bad press</strong></span><span>. Goldfish get </span><strong><span>a bad press</span></strong><span>. Social media gets </span><strong><span>a bad press</span></strong><span>. And this means they all get criticism in the media.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And we had <strong>fishy</strong></span><span>. If something's fishy, it's suspicious. </span></p><p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And we had <strong>multitask</strong></span><span>. To </span><strong><span>multitask</span></strong><span> is to do several things at once. </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Then we had <strong>down to</strong></span><span>. Here it means 'depends on', though it can mean other things in other contexts. You could say, it's all </span><strong><span>down</span></strong><span> to the context!</span></p><p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And that's our quick review, and our programme for today. So, did you stay focused all the way through? Or were you <strong>distracted</strong></span><span>?</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>If you're looking for <strong>distractions</strong></span><span> – may I recommend our Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube pages?</span></p><p><strong><span>Both<br/></span></strong><span>Goodbye.</span></p>",Transcript,<p><strong><span>attention span</span></strong><span> <br/></span><span> the length of time you can focus on something</span></p><p><strong><span>to distract</span></strong><br/><span> </span><span>to take someone's focus away from something</span></p><p><strong><span>a bad press<br/></span><span> </span></strong><span>criticism in the media</span></p><p><strong><span>fishy<br/></span><span> </span></strong><span>suspicious</span></p><p><strong><span>to multitask<br/></span><span> </span></strong><span>to do several things at once</span></p><p><strong><span>down to<br/></span><span> </span></strong><span>(here) depending on</span></p>,Vocabulary

And they teach you six items of useful vocabulary", 11 May 2017,"<p><em>Note: This is not a word for word transcript</em></p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English– the show that brings you an interesting topic, authentic listening practice and six new items of vocabulary. I'm Dan…</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I’m Neil. In this episode we’ll be discussing food waste, just as soon as….</p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/> Neil, did you just throw the rest of that apple away?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yeah. It was quite a big one and I couldn’t finish it. </p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/> Neil, you know you shouldn’t <strong>waste</strong> food.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/> Waste</strong> meaning to throw away without consuming or using.  Ah, it’s only an apple. It’s not the end of the world, Dan.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Well, that’s where you could be wrong, my friend. Let me prove it to you, with this week’s question. How much of the world’s food is wasted each year?</p><p>a) a half</p><p>b) a third</p><p>c) a quarter</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/> I’m not sure. I know it’s a lot so I’m going to say a) a half</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>We’ll find out if you’re right or not at the end of this show. So, the actual figure is 1.3 billion tons of food, which is enough to feed a billion hungry people. Where do you think all this food waste comes from?</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/> Well, restaurants, I imagine. I mean, they can’t give one customer’s <strong>leftovers </strong>to another! That would be unhygienic!</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong><strong>Leftovers </strong>are the remains of food which has not been eaten. And while you are right, restaurants are not the main contributor to food waste.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Supermarkets! I bet they throw out loads of food once it goes past its sell-by-date, or the date which it can be legally sold by.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Think closer to home.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>It’s us, isn’t it?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Yes. In Europe an incredible 53% of food waste comes from households, which results in 88 million tonnes of food waste a year. And I bet you can’t guess what we do with it?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I want to say recycle, but I can see from your face, Dan, that it’s not.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>No. Unfortunately it goes into landfills and decays.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>A <strong>landfill </strong>is a place where rubbish is buried. I see, so the food rots and this causes greenhouse gasses which lead to global warming and climate change.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Exactly, and the end of the world. But, remarkably the European country of Denmark has managed to reduce its food waste by a very significant 25%</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>That’s impressive, how did that happen?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>They attribute it to a woman called Selina Juul.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I’ve heard about her. She became a <strong>household name</strong> in Denmark overnight!</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong><strong>A household name</strong> is one which everybody knows, and that’s right.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I thought she was Russian?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>She is. But, I’ll let her explain.</p><p><strong>INSERT<br/> Selina Juul<br/></strong>I come from a country where there were food shortages, back then in Moscow, communism collapsed, we had the collapse of <strong>infrastructure</strong>, we were not sure we could get food on the table. And coming to Denmark, seeing this <strong>abundance</strong>, seeing these supermarkets filled with food. But then I was really shocked to see a lot of food getting wasted.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So Selina grew up in Moscow at a time when there wasn’t enough food because of the collapse of <strong>infrastructure</strong>, meaning the basic systems and services of a society – such as food transportation.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Then when she moved to Denmark, she found an <strong>abundance</strong>, or more than enough, food, but she saw it being wasted.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So she decided to do something about it?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Yes. She started a Facebook page in 2008 called ‘stop wasting food’ and 9 years later the Danish government credits her for their reduction in food waste. </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>How did she do it?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Well, lots of ideas really. She convinced some supermarkets to stop selling their items in bulk so that people buy only what they need. She’s produced a <strong>leftovers</strong> cookbook and she’s working with three governments to set up an education programme in schools.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Wow, she’s a busy woman. So how about you educate me with the answer to this week’s question.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Sure! I asked you how much of the world’s food is wasted each year?</p><p>a) a half</p><p>b) a third</p><p>c) a quarter<br/> <strong><br/> Neil<br/> </strong>And I said a) a half</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>And I’m terribly sorry, mate, but you’re wrong. The answer is b) a third.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, it’s not as bad as I thought it was, at least.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Shall we look at the vocabulary then?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, let’s. First we had <strong>waste</strong>. If you <strong>waste</strong> something, you throw it away or lose it without using it or consuming it. Common things we <strong>waste</strong> are food, time, money and energy. We also have some expressions with <strong>waste </strong>too. Can you think of one, Dan?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>A <strong>waste of space</strong> is an expression which means a thing is completely without value. For example, I’m a complete waste of space in the kitchen. I can’t cook at all. Next we had <strong>leftovers. Leftovers</strong> are the remains of food or a meal, which have not been eaten. What do you tend to do with your <strong>leftovers</strong>, Neil?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Oh I love <strong>leftovers</strong>! Sometimes I think they taste even better than the original meal!</p><p><strong>Dan<br/> </strong>I agree! Pizza’s a great example!</p><p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>Then we had <strong>landfill</strong>. A <strong>landfill</strong> is a place where rubbish is dropped and buried. In colloquial English we might say, a <strong>dump</strong>. Do you ever take your rubbish to the <strong>dump</strong>, Dan?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Not if I can help it. I prefer to recycle as much as possible. I only go to the <strong>dump </strong>if I have to get rid of a large appliance, such as a fridge. Then we had <strong>a household name</strong>. To be <strong>a household name</strong> is to be well-known by ordinary people of a particular place or culture. Can you think of a person who is <strong>a household name</strong> at the moment, Neil?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Oh, that’s very easy. Donald Trump springs to mind! Everyone must know who he is. Then we had <strong>infrastructure</strong>. <strong>Infrastructure</strong> is the basic systems and services of a society – such as electricity supply, trains, and roads.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>And finally we had <strong>abundance</strong>. If you have an <strong>abundance</strong> of something, you have more than you need. Do have anything in <strong>abundance</strong>, Neil?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, when it comes to my children I have to have an <strong>abundance</strong> of patience….well, most of the time. And, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English. Please join us again soon!</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>And we are on social media too - Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube.

And they teach you six items of useful vocabulary", 04 May 2017,"<p><em>Note: This is not a word for word transcript</em></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English – the programme where we bring you an interesting topic and six items of vocabulary. I'm Neil.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And I'm Catherine. Today we're taking a look into the lives of the super rich – and we're going to look at one of their favourite pastimes.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>The super rich are people with over $30 million US dollars of <strong>assets</strong>.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong><strong>Assets</strong> are things we can own and sell – like property, boats and private planes.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Expensive toys. First things first, let's do our question, Catherine. In which country is the percentage of super rich expected to grow fastest over the next 10 years?</p><p>a)    China</p><p>b)    Brazil</p><p>c)    Vietnam?</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>I'm going to go for Vietnam. I think, that's an up and coming country and I think there is going to be a lot of growth in wealth in the future.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Ok, well we'll find out if you are right or wrong later. The number of super rich are expected to increase by 43% over the next decade.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Now, this doesn't mean income is rising at the same speed for everyone. You might remember a report last year which said the world's richest 62 individuals owned as much as the poorest 50% of people in the whole world.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So, my question is – what on earth do people with so much money spend it on?</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>One academic in the UK has been researching just that. And her answer is …, Neil?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yachts! A yacht – a luxury boat used for pleasure. The ultimate <strong>status symbol</strong> – that is, an item which allows you to show off your wealth and position in society.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Let's listen to Emma Spence from Cardiff University in the UK. What's so unusual about yachts?</p><p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Emma Spence, PhD researcher, Cardiff University<br/></strong>If you have an exclusive wine collection or art collection or even the purchase of a business jet – these are investable <strong>assets</strong> – something that you can retain value on or accrue value on. A business jet, a private jet, can cut costs – and make businesses more convenient by running faster, more comfortably than commercial airlines. So these purchases, they <strong>make</strong> good, sound <strong>business sense</strong>. Whereas a superyacht is essentially a <strong>black hole</strong>.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Before we get to the yacht, Emma talked about certain <strong>assets</strong> like planes and wine that <strong>made business sense</strong>.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Now, to make sense – is a phrase you'll be familiar with. So, if we say something <strong>makes business sense</strong>, it means 'it's good for business'. But yachts are different.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yachts, and especially what she calls superyachts, actually lose money. So much so, she calls a superyacht a <strong>black hole</strong> of wealth.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>A <strong>black hole</strong>, in scientific terms, is a place where gravity is so strong that nothing can escape – not even light. So, in business terms, a black hole eats all your money!</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>It's also used conversationally to mean 'a place where things go missing'.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>These superyachts are big. The world's longest is 180m in length. And they require a professional crew. Which is how Emma began her study – she used to work on the yachts.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>She's now spent six years studying the world of superyachts and the super rich.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>So, what else did she learn?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>She says that in the world of the super rich – the size of your yacht shows your place in <strong>the pecking order</strong>.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>The <strong>pecking order</strong> means 'the social system from most powerful to least powerful'.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>If you're higher up in the yachting <strong>pecking order</strong>, you get the best place in the harbour. Which is very important to yacht owners, apparently.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Apparently, so. It's all about seeing and being seen. You could actually say that yachts are the ultimate form of <strong>conspicuous consumption</strong>. Now that's another great term – conspicuous means 'visible or noticeable' and consumption means 'spending'. So, the phrase <strong>conspicuous consumption</strong> refers to the kind of buying you do so that other people notice your money.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Before we sail off into the sunset Catherine, how about we answer today's question.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>I said that Vietnam is the country in which the percentage of super rich is expected to grow fastest over the next 10 years.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, I'm very pleased to say that you were right. It was in fact Vietnam – according to the same report by Knight Frank – the population of ultra wealthy is expected to grow by a staggering 170% in the next decade.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Now, how about we have another look at the wealth of vocabulary in this programme?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Very good. We started with <strong>assets</strong> – here it means 'things we can buy or sell'. What are your assets?</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Oh, you know, my diamond rings, my bike, my laptop. I'm not like you though Neil, I don't live in an expensive mansion – that would be a real <strong>status symbol</strong>!</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>If only that were true, but it's a good example. A <strong>status symbol</strong> is a possession that shows off our wealth and our place in society.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Yes, and we had the phrase to <strong>make business sense</strong> – in other words to be good for business. We could also say that a particular policy makes economic sense.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Or I could say investing wisely makes financial sense. Not like yachts which are expensive to buy and run. In fact, they're a <strong>black hole</strong> for our money.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Now, did you know our next phrase, <strong>pecking order</strong>, actually comes from chicken behaviour?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And finally, the phrase <strong>conspicuous consumption</strong>. For example, you could say that dining at the finest restaurants wearing expensive clothes is <strong>conspicuous consumption</strong>.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And to clear up two similar phrases: a <strong>status symbol</strong> refers to the object itself, like a luxury car; whereas <strong>conspicuous consumption</strong> refers to the act of spending money on things like expensive cars but you're spending money so that other people notice.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Do check us out on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube.</p><p><strong>Neil &amp; Catherine<br/></strong>Bye!</p>",Transcript,<p><strong>assets<br/> </strong>things you can buy and sell</p><p><strong>status symbol</strong><br/> something you own to show off your wealth and social position</p><p><strong>to make business sense</strong><br/> to be good for business</p><p><strong>black hole<br/> </strong>somewhere impossible to escape</p><p><strong>pecking order<br/> </strong>the informal social system from most to least powerful</p><p><strong>conspicuous consumption</strong><br/> spending a lot of money so other people notice your wealth</p>,Vocabulary

Well, I once fell off the side of a mountain, but I was saved by a tree.</p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/> That's incredible!<br/> <br/> <strong>Neil</strong><br/> Why do you ask?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Well, I recently heard a story about Alcides Moreno.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/> Who's that?<br/> <br/> <strong>Dan<br/></strong>He's a window cleaner. He cleaned the windows on the sky scrapers in New York. Except one day, he fell. </p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/> Oh my goodness.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Yes. And what's more is. He survived.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Wow! How far did he fall?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Ah, well, all will be revealed after this week’s question. According to the BBC, what chance of survival does a human have when falling to the ground from around 3 storeys?</p><p>a)    30%</p><p>b)    50%</p><p>c)    70%</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And by storeys, you mean the entire floor of a building including all its rooms. Well, I think it’s got to be b) 50%</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Well, we'll find out if you're right or not later. So, do you want to hear the story?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Of course!</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Well, on the 7th of December, Ecuadorians Alcides Moreno, and his brother, Edgar, went up to the top of the Solow Tower in New York to clean the windows like they did every day.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And how tall is that building?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>It's 47 storeys.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And how did they usually clean it?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Well, they used a <strong>scaffold</strong>, which is a structure of interconnected pipes and boards that creates a frame or shape</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/> Ah, so in this case there was a platform which was attached by cables, or large metal ropes, and hung over the edge of the building and which the window cleaners could raise and lower.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Exactly. So, as usual they filled up their buckets and climbed on to the <strong>scaffold</strong>.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And…</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Well, unfortunately the cables were loose, and the scaffold fell from the building. Both brothers fell 47 storeys.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>That's terrible! What happened next?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>I’ll let Jo Fidgen, presenter of the BBC show Outlook, explain</p><p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Jo Fidgen – BBC Outlook presenter<br/></strong>When firefighters arrived on the scene, they found a crowd of distraught onlookers pointing towards an alleyway. Edgar had landed on a fence and couldn't be helped, but Alcides was found crouching in a pile of twisted metal still <strong>clutching</strong> the controls of the scaffold. He was breathing…even trying to stand up…</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So, firefighters arrived to find a group of distraught, which means extremely worried and upset, people showing them where the two men had come down.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Yes, and though, unfortunately, Edgar didn't survive, Alcides was found <strong>clutching</strong>, or holding extremely tightly, to the controls of the scaffold.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Did I hear correctly that he was trying to stand up? Did he escape the accident <strong>unscathed</strong>?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong><strong>Unscathed </strong>means without any injury at all. And, no, he fell into a coma for 3 weeks and needed 24 pints of blood. </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I'm speechless. I don't understand how he lived.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>You aren't the only one. Listen to what Dr. Philip Barie, from New York-Presbyterian Hospital, said about the whole incident.</p><p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Philip Barie, New York-Presbyterian Hospital</strong></p><p>I don't know what adjective you'd care to use: <strong>unprecedented</strong>, extraordinary… if you are a believer in <strong>miracles</strong>, this would be one.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Wow. So he can’t explain it either. He said it was <strong>unprecedented</strong> which means never happened or done before.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Yes, and he also said that this was a <strong>miracle</strong>, which is an unexplainable positive outcome to a bad situation that people say was the intervention of a god.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I guess we'll never know. But one thing I can know is the answer to this week's question.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/> </strong>Ah, yes. I asked you what chance of survival does a human have when falling to the ground from around 3 storeys?</p><p>a)    30%</p><p>b)    50%</p><p>c)    70%</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I said b) 50%</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>And you were exactly right. Well done.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>Wow! It's a first!</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Shall we look at the vocabulary then?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>First we had <strong>a near-death experience</strong>, which is an experience where a person very nearly, or could easily have died. Have you ever had one, Dan?</p><p><strong>Dan</strong> <br/> When I was 14 I fell out of a canoe into a river and got stuck between the boat and a rock with my head underwater. I thought it was the end. But, some people pulled me out. Then we had <strong>scaffold</strong>. A <strong>scaffold</strong> is a structure of interconnected pipes and boards that creates a frame or shape. Name a place that you might see <strong>scaffolding</strong>, Neil.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>They are usually put up around houses when builders are working on the roof. Then we had <strong>clutching</strong>. If you <strong>clutch</strong> something, it means you hold it extremely tightly. There is a well-known idiom that uses this word. Sound familiar, Dan?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Ah, <strong>you're clutching at straws</strong>, Neil, which means you are trying to find a reason or hope to succeed when it’s extremely unlikely. What was after that?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>After that we had <strong>unscathed</strong>. If you are <strong>unscathed</strong>, you are uninjured. We often talk about <strong>escaping</strong> something <strong>unscathed</strong>. Have you ever <strong>escaped</strong> an accident <strong>unscathed</strong>?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Well, when I was 6, I fell through a hole that some builders had made while doing rennovation. I hit the ground in the garage, but somehow I <strong>escaped unscathed</strong>. Maybe, I bounced? Then we heard <strong>unprecedented</strong>. If something is <strong>unprecedented</strong>, it has never happened or been done before. Can you think of an example, Neil?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Neil Armstrong walking on the moon was <strong>unprecedented</strong> in 1969. And, finally, we had <strong>miracle</strong>. A <strong>miracle</strong> is an unexplainable positive outcome to a bad situation that people say was the intervention of a god. The adjectives is <strong>miraculous</strong>.</p><p>Do you believe in <strong>miracles</strong>, Dan?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/> </strong>Well, I've never seen or experienced one, but when you hear a story like this, it's difficult not to. And, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English. Please join us again soon!</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And we are on social media too - Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube.

I’m Dan. And today we’re talking about...</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Sighing. I’m Catherine.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Now – was that a real sigh – or just one to demonstrate the meaning?</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>That one was just for educational purposes, of course, Dan.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>We’ll be looking at why we sigh, and learn how sighing keeps us alive!</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Yes, very interesting. And it’s not just humans that sigh, is it, Dan?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Indeed, most mammals sigh. And that brings me to today’s question. How many times does a mouse sigh in an hour, on average? Is it?</p><p>a)    Twice</p><p>b)    10 times</p><p>c)    40 times</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>I’m going to say the poor little thing will sigh about 40 times an hour</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>OK. Let’s find out if you’re right later on in the programme. Now, what is a sigh, exactly?</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Let’s hear from Dr Lynne Barker, a cognitive neuroscientist from Sheffield Hallam University in the UK.</p><p><strong>INSERT <br/></strong><strong>Dr Lynne Barker, Cognitive Neuroscientist, Sheffield Hallam University<br/></strong>It’s a typically cardio-respiratory kind of <strong>resetting</strong> mechanism, and most mammals will engage in sighing of some kind. Because people who don’t sigh would eventually die. It is a<strong> survival mechanism</strong>.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>So sighing keeps us alive.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Dr Barker called it a <strong>survival mechanism</strong>. To survive means to continue living, especially in difficult circumstances. A <strong>mechanism</strong>, here, means a system of behaviour.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>So, a <strong>survival mechanism</strong> is something the body does automatically in order to survive. But, Dan, why is sighing a <strong>survival mechanism</strong>?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>It’s because sighing can <strong>reset</strong> the lungs. To <strong>reset</strong> is to return something to its original settings. We often use this verb when talking about technology. You can <strong>reset</strong> a computer or a phone.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>OK, that’s fine. But how does a sigh <strong>reset</strong> the lungs?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Well, scientists from UCLA, that’s the University of California, Los Angeles, found that a sigh is a special kind of very deep breath that keeps the tiny sacs of air in our lungs, called alveoli, working properly.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And without sighing, these alveoli would collapse and we would die. We need the alveoli to transfer oxygen from our lungs to our blood.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Thankfully, we don’t have to think about this need to <strong>reset </strong>our lungs. Sighing is in fact a <strong>reflex</strong>.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Boo!</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Argh!</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>There – you jumped! And that was a fabulous <strong>reflex</strong>, Dan! It’s something our bodies do without thinking, something you do unconsciously or automatically.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>I meant… argh… like a man. Thank you for that, Catherine.</p><p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/> You’re welcome.<br/> <br/> <strong>Dan</strong><br/> Do you sigh a lot?</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Well, I sigh when I’m tired, and I sigh when I’m relieved. I <strong>breathe a sigh of relief</strong>.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong><strong>To breathe a sigh of relief </strong>– that’s a great expression. It means what you think it means – to sigh when you feel good that something bad has not happened – but it’s often used metaphorically. It relates more to the feeling of relief than the act of sighing.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>That’s right. Now, I <strong>breathed a sigh of relief</strong> when I found my mobile phone the other day. I thought I’d lost it. It was new. I was so pleased when I found it! What about you, Dan?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>I tend to sigh to show <strong>frustration</strong>. And sometimes <strong>resignation</strong>.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Now, <strong>frustration</strong> is what we feel when things aren’t going well, when things are annoying us and they don’t work. When things are <strong>frustrating</strong>.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>And <strong>resignation</strong> is what we feel when we finally accept that something bad has happened, that we can’t change. We feel <strong>resigned</strong> to something.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>So, relief, resignation, frustration, resetting our lungs. It sounds like we humans never stop sighing!</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Well, actually, we humans sigh on average 12 times an hour. But what about… mice?</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Well, I said, I reckon they sigh about 40 times an hour.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Well, in fact, it is 40 times an hour. The hearts of mice beat faster – so they need to regulate their lungs more than humans.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Let’s review today’s vocabulary.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>We had the phrase <strong>survival mechanism</strong>. Something we do without thinking that keeps us alive.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>We often use this phrase, and the related phrase defence mechanism, when talking about what people do to cope with difficulties in life.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Next, we had <strong>reset</strong>. You can reset a computer, or a machine – to make it work again. This usually means switching it off and on again.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And you can reset a password – this is a little bit different. It means to set – or choose - a new password.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>We also had the word <strong>reflex</strong>. This is a physical action or reaction that you can’t control. For example… Catherine?</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Yes?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>There, you closed your eyes. Another <strong>reflex</strong>.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And we had <strong>to</strong> <strong>breathe a sigh to relief</strong>. Which means to feel better after something bad doesn’t happen. I breathed a sigh of relief when my friend recovered from her illness.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>But we sigh for other reasons too. Two useful sighing words were: <strong>frustration</strong> and <strong>resignation</strong>.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong><strong>Frustration</strong> is the state of being <strong>frustrated</strong>. We can say something is <strong>frustrating</strong>. It’s <strong>frustrating</strong> when the boss doesn’t listen to me.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>But let’s say you move beyond feeling <strong>frustrated</strong> and start feeling <strong>resigned</strong>.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Yeah, and that would be when I finally accept the boss will never listen to me. And that’s when I’ll <strong>resign</strong>!</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>To <strong>resign</strong> also means to voluntarily leave a job! Please, Catherine, tell me that’s just another vocabulary example?!</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Of course it is, Dan. I love my job! I only ever sigh, what, 12 times an hour?!</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Which is perfectly average. And that's it for today's 6 Minute English.

Were they:</p><p>a) Farmers</p><p>b) Spies</p><p>c) Guards</p><p>Listen to the programme to find out the answer.</p>",This week's question:,"In this programme, Dan and Neil discuss the trend for having more than one career. They also teach you six items of useful vocabulary. (Image: Getty)", 13 Apr 2017,"<p><em>This is not a word for word transcript</em></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English – the programme where we bring you an interesting topic and six items of vocabulary. I’m Neil. Today we’re talking about jobs.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>And I’m Dan. And specifically, we’re looking at the trend for having more than one job…</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes. On that note – Dan, were you ever asked this question as a kid? “What do you want to be when you grow up?” Do you remember your answer?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>I wanted to be a ninja turtle. And you?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>That doesn’t surprise me. I think I wanted to be a professional footballer. I wanted to play for England. Well, for many people, that question gets harder the older they become! It’s one reason why more and more people have what we call <strong>portfolio </strong>careers these days – so they can do a bit of everything.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>A <strong>portfolio</strong>, as a noun, means 'a case for carrying large pictures – or it can mean the collection of pictures themselves. But we also use it as an adjective to describe groups of certain things – in this case, careers.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Indeed, we could say someone who is a part-time teacher and a part-time musician has a <strong>portfolio</strong> career.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Sounds like a good combination. First, let’s do today’s question – it’s job-related. Many surnames in English originally come from professions. The surname Baker, for example, was originally given to people who worked as… bakers! What about the surname Bond, as in double-oh-seven, James Bond? Who had this surname? Was it?</p><p>a)    Farmers<br/>b)    Spies<br/>c)    Guards</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>It can’t be spies, can it? So I’m going to guess guards. C.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Great, well let’s find out at the end of the programme.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Now, the <strong>portfolio</strong> career. Emily Wapnick is the Canadian author of a book called How to Be Everything: A Guide for Those Who (Still) Don’t Know What They Want to Be When They Grow Up.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Which specific example of a <strong>portfolio</strong> career does she mention?</p><p><strong>INSERT <br/></strong><strong>Emily Wapnick, Author<br/></strong>More and more people are doing multiple things and multiple jobs - and it’s not just <strong>to make ends meet</strong>. A lot of people are choosing this kind of lifestyle. They’ve got, you know,  three different businesses that are just thriving. Or they’re a <strong>serial</strong> <strong>entrepreneur</strong>. Or they’ve got a career in two different areas. There’s a guy that I mention who is a psychotherapist and a luthier – he makes violins - and he’s very successful in both.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Emily is clearly a fan of this kind of working. She says she knows a man who’s both a psychotherapist and a luthier – someone who makes violins.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>She says this trend is more than just about working to <strong>make ends meet</strong> – in other words, working to make enough money to live. And she used another interesting expression – a <strong>serial</strong> <strong>entrepreneur</strong> – what’s that exactly?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, an <strong>entrepreneur</strong> is someone who starts and runs businesses – and the use of <strong>serial</strong> here as an adjective describes someone who does the same thing again and again. Though we should say, the adjective is more often used for criminal activity – such as a <strong>serial</strong> <strong>killer</strong> or <strong>serial</strong> <strong>murderer</strong>.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Not the kind of <strong>portfolio</strong> career I had in mind. A <strong>serial entrepreneur</strong>, on the other hand, starts and runs business after business.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Another thing, because Emily believes the world of work is changing fast – it’s sensible to be able to do more than one thing. In other words, it’s wise to <strong>add another string to your bow</strong>.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>A great phrase, which really just means 'to learn new skills you can use in the future'. I’d like to learn Japanese – that would <strong>add another string to my bow</strong>.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So desu, ne? But choosing a <strong>portfolio</strong> career is not for everyone, of course. It often simply comes down to money.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Here’s Charles Handy, writer and philosopher, and the man who popularised the term <strong>portfolio career</strong> in the first place.</p><p><strong>INSERT <br/></strong><strong>Charles Handy, writer<br/></strong>80% of the people in <strong>corporate</strong> jobs hate them, or are dissatisfied with them. Whereas if you’re doing your own thing, 80% of them really like the freedom and the entrepreneurial spirit, even if they’re not making an awful lot of money. It’s a balancing job really, you’re free but you’re poor. Or you’re slaved but you’re richer.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Sounds like a difficult choice – be poor or be a slave. What would you choose, Dan?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>I’d rather be poor and free, thank you very much.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, let’s explain a term he used – a <strong>corporate</strong> job. What does <strong>corporate</strong> mean?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Quite literally, it’s the adjective from the term corporation - a <strong>corporate</strong> job is a job at a big corporation, company or organisation – usually well paid, and with certain benefits.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Could we say James Bond has a <strong>corporate</strong> career?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Yes, I guess so! And thank you for reminding me to answer today’s question: which profession does the surname Bond come from?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I said the Bonds were guards.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>I’m afraid you were wrong. Bonds were originally peasant farmers who were bound to work for a particular lord. This word goes back over 1,000 years… the spying game came much later!</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Indeed! Let’s spy today’s words once more. We had <strong>portfolio</strong> – which can be used in different ways. There’s a <strong>portfolio</strong> career, as well as the original meaning of a <strong>portfolio</strong> of art. Any others?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Yes, people talk about a <strong>portfolio</strong> of investments – when you invest in several companies at once to reduce the risk.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Talking of money, we had to <strong>make ends meet</strong>. People often work a number of different part-time jobs to <strong>make ends meet </strong>– to make enough money to live on.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Though having a lot of part-time jobs is not the same as being a <strong>serial entrepreneur</strong>. <strong>Serial</strong> means doing something repeatedly, usually a crime!</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And an <strong>entrepreneur</strong> is someone who starts and runs businesses.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>I’d love to start a business… First, I need to learn a new skill - <strong>add another string to my bow</strong> and learn yoga. Then maybe one day I’ll run a yoga business.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Not for me though, I prefer the <strong>corporate</strong> life – a secure job in a big corporation!</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>OK, but then you can come to my yoga classes after work! </p><p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>Alright. <br/> <br/> <strong>Dan</strong><br/> And that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

I'm Dan…<br/><strong><br/></strong><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I'm Neil. Now, a favourite topic today: food, and how food can influence your mood. Dan, tell me, what food makes you happy?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Oh, you know, ice cream, chocolate… chocolate always puts a smile on my face.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And a few inches round your waistline! Sadly, the research we’ll be looking at today doesn’t suggest you eat more chocolate… but it does talk about bacteria!</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Bacteria – those simple, small organisms – they make me happy?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Absolutely, the so-called ‘good’ bacteria do! We’ll get to that, but first we’ll look at today’s question. How many bacteria are there in the human body?</p><p>a) 39 million</p><p>b) 39 billion</p><p>c) 39 trillion</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>They are pretty small. I’m going to go for c) 39 trillion.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, we’ll find out if you’re right… by counting them one by one.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>That’s going to take longer than six minutes!</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes it is, so let’s get moving! Scientists believe your mental state is connected to the bacteria in your <strong>gut</strong>.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>My <strong>gut</strong> - my stomach and the other organs my food passes through…</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes. Researchers at McMaster University in Canada and University College Cork in Ireland have found that certain bacteria help reduce <strong>anxiety </strong>in mice…</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong><strong>Anxiety</strong> – the state of being worried or anxious. I don’t like the sound of an anxious mouse.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well I’m afraid there’s another mouse experiment coming up. Researchers at Kyushu University found <strong>germ</strong>-free mice showed more stress…</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong><strong>Germs</strong> – a general word for bacteria and microorganisms, usually the ones which cause disease… So <strong>germs</strong> help reduce stress and anxiety in mice. Any research on humans?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>The BBC TV programme Trust me, I’m a Doctor has just explored this. They looked at foods which are high in ‘good’ bacteria – a claim which more and more food products are making these days.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Yes, it’s a phrase that appears a lot in marketing.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>But many traditional foods are high in good bacteria as well. They found that homemade <strong>fermented</strong> food was best.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>So things like miso soup, kimchi, yoghurt, sauerkraut – all these are <strong>fermented</strong>. Have you tried all of those?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I love miso soup and kimchi. And fermentation is the process where sugars in food are turned into acids and alcohol.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong><strong>Fermented foods</strong> are full of lots of good bacteria for your <strong>gut</strong>… Anything else from the BBC programme?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, this is the man behind the BBC study, Dr Michael Mosley. In this clip, a radio presenter asks him about the best kind of food to make us happy.</p><p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Dr Michael Mosley interviewed on BBC Radio 4</strong></p><p><strong>Presenter<br/> </strong>What’s the good mood food? What shall we eat now to cheer ourselves up?</p><p><strong>Dr Michael Mosley<br/></strong>Mediterranean <strong>diet</strong>. Olive oil; oily fish, full of omega 3, which is really good for the brain; whole grains; lots of fruits and vegetables. Sugar: terrible for you.</p><p><strong>Presenter<br/></strong>Not chocolate eclairs then?</p><p><strong>Dr Michael Mosley<br/></strong>Sadly not. That will make you feel good for about 30 seconds until you finish it and then you feel terribly guilty.</p><p><strong>Presenter<br/></strong>Right, ok. Mediterranean it is.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>He said the best kind of food is the Mediterranean <strong>diet</strong>. Now, a <strong>diet</strong> can mean 'an eating plan designed to help you lose weight'.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>But that’s not what it means here. Here it refers to the food and drink eaten by a group of people – in this case, the people living around the Mediterranean Sea.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Lots of oily fish, olive oil, grains, fruits and vegetables. And of course, add in plenty of <strong>fermented</strong> food too.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And don’t eat too many fatty, sugary, chocolaty things like chocolate eclairs – those are buns filled with cream and covered in chocolate. It’s really <strong>not rocket science</strong>, is it?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Eating healthily is pretty straightforward, even if the science behind it is complex. When you say something is <strong>not rocket science</strong>, you mean 'it’s not difficult to understand'.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Now, are you ready for some counting?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Ah yes, you wanted me to count all the bacteria in my body! I said 39 trillion.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And you were right. The number goes up and down, but on average we’re thought to have around 39 trillion bacterial cells in the body, according to the Weizmann Institute in Israel. The interesting thing is they think that there are only 30 trillion human cells in the body.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>So there’s more bacteria than human in me?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, maybe just you, Dan! Now, before the bacteria take over completely, let’s look over today’s words one more time.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong><strong>Gut</strong> was first. It means 'the stomach and other organs which digest our food'. But here’s an extra tip - the word can also mean ‘bravery’ when used in the plural. You’ve got <strong>guts</strong>, Neil, wearing that crazy shirt in this office!</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Why thank you. Maybe I don’t feel any <strong>anxiety</strong> about how I look! <strong>Anxiety</strong> was our second word, and it means 'fear or worry'. The adjective is anxious.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>You know what makes me anxious? <strong>Germs</strong>. I wash my hands fifty times a day. I can’t stand the idea of getting ill from all the <strong>germs</strong> around here.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, <strong>germs</strong> are tiny organisms, and usually refers to those which carry disease. But as we heard, certain <strong>germs</strong> are good for you!</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Especially those which are in<strong> fermented </strong>food. That’s food which has gone through a process where sugars turn into acids and alcohol. They often taste sour or bitter.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>We also talk about <strong>fermenting</strong> alcoholic drinks. Beer and wine are <strong>fermented</strong>.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Does that mean I should make them a part of my <strong>diet</strong>? A <strong>diet</strong> not only means 'a healthy eating plan', but can also mean 'the foods and drinks consumed by an individual or group'. Which country has the best <strong>diet</strong>, Neil?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, in my opinion the Japanese <strong>diet</strong>. It’s my favourite anyway – very varied and plenty of <strong>fermented</strong> food!</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>And finally we had –<strong> it’s not rocket science</strong> – it’s simple to understand. An example?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Brewing beer <strong>isn’t rocket science</strong> – you just need hops, yeast and patience.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>And there we are – a rocket speed review of today’s words!

I'm Dan…</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>…And I'm Neil. We’ll be discussing dogs being used in cancer detection.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Everything ok, Neil?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I am so tired. One of my children <strong>is as sick as a dog</strong>. I didn’t sleep all night long looking after them.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong><strong>As sick as a dog </strong>is an expression meaning ‘very ill’. I’m sorry to hear it. Try and hold on if you can.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Don’t worry. There’s life in this old dog yet.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Good. It’s funny that you mention dogs because apparently, the UK’s National Health Service is currently assessing whether dogs can be used to detect early stage prostate cancer.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Amazing. Any success?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Let me ask you in this week’s question. In what percentage of cases were dogs able to detect the presence of cancer in urine?  Is it </p><p>a) 50%</p><p>b) 70%</p><p>c) 90%</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/> I’m going to guess a) 50%<br/> <br/> <strong>Dan<br/></strong>We’ll find out later if you’re right or wrong. So, Neil, I say dog, what do you think?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>A wet nose, four <strong>paws,</strong> which is what we call the feet of certain animals, a fluffy coat and a waggy tail? Man’s best friend? But I’ve never heard of cancer dogs. I wonder what makes them suitable?  </p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Well, I’ll let Dr Claire Guest, CEO of the charity Medical Detection Dogs take that one.</p><p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Dr Claire Guest, CEO of Medical Detection Dogs<br/></strong>Although the dog has a fluffy coat and a waggy tail, he is in fact a highly sophisticated <strong>bio-sensor</strong>. You know, evolution has given him this highly sensitive nose, going down to parts per trillion. People board planes every day that have been <strong>screened</strong> by detector dogs to see if there are explosives on board. Why do we rely on them there and yet not in assisting us with health?</p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/> So, dogs have evolved to have a highly-developed sense of smell that allows them to act as a <strong>bio-sensor</strong>, a sensor which uses a living thing to detect chemicals. <br/> <strong><br/> Neil<br/></strong>Yes, and she mentioned that humans have a history of using dogs in security to <strong>screen</strong>, or examine for suitability, for explosives and bombs. </p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Yep! Can you think of any other places that dogs are used to support humans?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, there’s guide dogs, or seeing-eye dogs as they’re known in North America. They help people who are blind to avoid danger. </p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Nice. Any more? Maybe around the home?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Are you referring to guard dogs, meaning ‘a dog which keeps a house or place safe from burglary, theft or trespassing.’</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Yep. Ex-burglars have often said that they’re a much bigger <strong>deterrent</strong>, or reason not to do something, than an alarm system.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Oh and there’s rescue dogs. They are trained to search and find victims of natural disasters such as avalanches or earthquakes.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Exactly, dogs are perfect for situations where people may be buried under the earth or the snow. A human can’t see them but a dog can still smell them.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Do you think our National Health Service will employ them as full time <strong>biosensors</strong> then?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Well, I don’t know, but here’s what Jeremy Hunt, the UK Health Secretary had to say on the matter.</p><p><strong>INSERT<br/> Jeremy Hunt, Health Secretary<br/> </strong>One of our jobs as MPs is sometimes to question <strong>orthodoxies</strong>, so if this research is good then I want to know about it, and I will certainly look at it carefully.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>He mentions that this type of research goes against <strong>orthodoxies</strong>, or generally accepted way of doing things. But he also mentions that he will be looking at it carefully. So let’s hope so.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes I wouldn’t mind having a dog doctor! And speaking of research, there was a question I need to know the answer to.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Oh yes. I asked you in what percentage of cases were dogs able to detect the presence of cancer in urine?</p><p>a) 50%</p><p>b) 70%</p><p>c) 90%</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I said 50%</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>It’s a dog’s life, Neil. I’m sorry. The answer was c) 90%</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Wow! 90%! That’s amazing. </p><p><strong>Dan<br/> </strong>Isn’t it?<br/> <br/> <strong>Neil</strong><br/> Shall we go through the vocabulary?<br/> <br/><strong>Dan<br/></strong>OK. The first expression we had was <strong>as sick as a dog</strong>. If you are <strong>as sick as a dog</strong> it means that you’re very sick indeed. When was the last time you were <strong>as sick as a dog</strong>, Neil?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Just after Christmas I caught a bug from my kids. I was <strong>as sick as a dog</strong>. Next we had <strong>paws</strong>. <strong>Paws</strong> are the feet of certain animals. They have pads and claws. Can you give us a few examples, Dan?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Well, dogs have <strong>paws</strong>. So do cats, rabbits, bears and mice. But not horses, sheep or pigs. They have hooves. After <strong>paws</strong>, we had <strong>biosensor</strong>. A <strong>biosensor</strong> is a combination of the words biology and sensor. It is a sensor which uses a living thing to detect chemicals. Can you think of a famous historical example, Neil?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, Miners in danger of a highly toxic but invisible gas called methane used to carry a canary in a cage down the mine with them. If the canary became ill or died, they knew that the air was toxic.  Then we had <strong>screen</strong>. If you screen something, it means you examine it for its suitability, such as luggage going through an airport – where they would <strong>screen</strong> for explosives.  How else can it be used, Dan?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/> </strong>Well, these days you can get an ad-blocker on your computer that will <strong>screen out</strong> those annoying pop-up adverts. I hate those! After that was <strong>deterrent</strong>. A deterrent is a thing which stops a person from doing something, such as the fear of punishment for a crime. How do you deter your children from being naughty, Neil?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>That’s easy. I just threaten to remove a sticker from their sticker chart. </p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/> Good idea!<br/> <br/> <strong>Neil</strong><br/> Finally, we heard <strong>orthodoxies</strong>. An <strong>orthodoxy</strong> is a generally accepted way of doing things. Its adjective is <strong>orthodox</strong> and we often hear its opposite word – <strong>unorthodox</strong>, meaning unusual. Do you do anything <strong>unorthodox</strong>, Dan?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Well I love to combine hot sausages and cold vanilla ice-cream. It’s delicious! But no one will trust me enough to try!</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I don’t blame them! Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

I'm Dan…</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I'm Neil. We’ll be discussing the rise of those little graphics we call emojis and emoticons. </p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>You know, I think emojis are a vital tool for communication. And actually, they’re not that new, either.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Oh really?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Well, that’s the perfect opportunity to ask this week’s question. When was the first emoticon used? Was it?</p><p>a)    1606</p><p>b)    1862</p><p>c)    1982</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>It must be 1982. I’ll go with c).</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>We’ll find out if you’re right or wrong later in the programme.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>You know, I think we should clear one thing up before we go any further: what’s the difference between an emoticon and an emoji?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Good point. Emoticons came first. They’re the images made using normal keys on a keyboard – usually punctuation, letters and numbers. For example a colon – two dots - followed by the curved line of a close brackets is a…</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>A smiley face. Something you use in way too many of your emails!</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Well, thanks! Whereas an emoji is something completely different. It’s an actual image. It could be a simple, yellow, smiley face; or something like a dancing lady; or even a bowl of noodles…</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Ah yes, all those little images we have in our phones. But you’ll have to convince me – why do people use them so much?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Well, let’s listen to Professor Vyv Evans. He wrote a book called The Emoji Code:</p><p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Professor Vyv Evans, Author of ‘The Emoji Code’<br/></strong>They enable us to express emotion and <strong>empathy</strong> in digital communication. Increasingly, what we’re finding is that digital communication is taking over from certain aspects of face-to-face <strong>interaction</strong>. In the UK today, for example, adults spend 22 hours online on average each week. One of the reasons emojis are so interesting is that they really do enable us to express our emotional selves much more effectively.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Ok so he used a very useful word - <strong>empathy</strong>. It means ‘the ability to show you understand someone else’s feelings’. Ok – tell me more Dan.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Yes – adding an emoticon can show you understand and express emotion, and show <strong>empathy</strong> – more clearly. In digital communication we lack the visual signals we have in face-to-face <strong>interaction</strong> – as he says.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong><strong>Interaction</strong>, meaning ‘when people or things communicate with each other’. We can also <strong>interact</strong> with things like machines, computers and social media.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Yes, Professor Evans says 60% of information when we’re talking to each other comes from <strong>non-verbal</strong> <strong>cues</strong>.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Wow, that’s a lot. A <strong>cue</strong> is a signal that you need to do something.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>For example, an actor goes on stage after their <strong>cue</strong>.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And <strong>non-verbal</strong> means ‘without using spoken language’. So, here in the studio there are lots of other <strong>non-verbal</strong> signals about how we’re feeling - <strong>non-verbal cues</strong>. For example my facial expression, my body language, the look in my eyes, Dan.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>There’s a glint of rage in there somewhere, Neil. Ok, so let’s apply this to digital communication. Imagine I sent you a text saying I hit my finger with a hammer – how would you respond?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, it depends. Did you hurt yourself badly?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>If I followed it with a sad face emoji, then…?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Then I guess I’d know you hurt yourself. Poor you.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>But if I followed it with a laughing emoji – the one with the tears coming out because I’m laughing so much?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Then I’d probably reply saying how stupid and <strong>clumsy</strong> you are!</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Exactly – without adding the emoji – it’s hard to know my emotional state. The emoji is the <strong>non-verbal cue</strong> – like my facial expression.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>By the way, is there an emoji meaning <strong>clumsy</strong>? <strong>Clumsy</strong>, means ‘physically awkward’ – someone who’s <strong>clumsy</strong> falls over a lot and drops things.Anyway, you were saying emoticons aren’t as new as I think?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Yes, I asked when they were invented. Is it a)1606, b)1862 or c)1982?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I said 1982.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Well, in fact, a witty speech Abraham Lincoln reprinted in a newspaper as far back as 1862 included a semi colon with a close brackets.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Like a winking face?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Exactly. Though people think this was sadly just a typographical error – or what we normally call a <strong>typo</strong>.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>A <strong>typo</strong> – a spelling mistake made when typing too fast or carelessly.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/> </strong>The official birth of emoticons is usually given as 1982, when a US professor instructed his students to use smiley faces to indicate jokes - in a digital communication.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Wow, so they’re over 30 years old. Maybe I should start using them. Let’s round up with another look at today’s words.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Sure. The first word we had was <strong>empathy</strong>. Do you have a lot of <strong>empathy</strong>, Neil?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, I think I’m quite good at understanding other people’s feelings. My friends tell me that, anyway! It’s important to <strong>empathise</strong> with your colleagues too.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>That’s not what I saw in your eyes! Yes, <strong>empathy</strong> is an important part of all human <strong>interaction</strong>.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Nicely done. If two people <strong>interact</strong>, it means they ‘communicate with each other and react to each other’. It’s a pretty broad term.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>We could also talk about how the way children <strong>interact</strong> with the internet.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Way too much! Next up, we had <strong>non-verbal</strong>, meaning ‘without spoken language’. When I first travelled to Poland, I used a lot of <strong>non-verbal</strong> communication to get my message across. Hand movements, counting with fingers, things like that. Next word, Dan?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Next word… that is my <strong>cue </strong>to say the next word – which is in fact – <strong>cue</strong>. A cue is a signal to do something. A commander could give his officer a <strong>cue</strong> to attack. Or I could give you a <strong>cue</strong> to… sing a song?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>No thanks. I’ll stick with defining words, thank you. Like <strong>clumsy</strong> – meaning ‘physically awkward’. I’d have to say Dan, you’re a sporty guy, a talented footballer - you’re not <strong>clumsy</strong> at all.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>That’s what I thought until I broke my leg – after a <strong>clumsy</strong> opponent ran into me…</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Ouch. Finally – we had type. No hang on, that’s not right. It should say <strong>typo</strong>. A <strong>typo</strong> is a mistake in a written document, or a digital file or message.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Always check your scripts for <strong>typos</strong> before reading them, Neil. And, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English. Please join us again soon!</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And we are on social media too - Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube.

I'm Dan…</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I'm Neil. In this programme we’ll be discussing the lovely topic of lunch – and what our lunch choices say about us<em>. </em>So, Dan, what are you doing for lunch today?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Ah Neil, are you asking me to join you? I’d love to, thanks. There’s this great little Vietnamese place we have to check out, right next to the office if you just…</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Ah, actually – I was just asking to… open up today’s topic. Sorry. You see, I’ve brought a sandwich.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Oh, a sandwich. Again! How dull. Well, you’re not the only one – a survey from 2012 showed a third of Britons eat exactly the same thing for lunch – every day! And yes, it’s mostly sandwiches.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I had a curry yesterday.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Well, it’s almost lunchtime so we’d better get on with our question, which is: how long is the average lunch break in the UK? Is it:</p><p>a) An hour and a half</p><p>b) 45 minutes</p><p>c) 25 minutes</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Oh, I wish it was an hour and a half, but I’m pretty sure it must be c) 25 minutes</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Well, we’ll find out if you’re right… just before lunch! All this talk of lunch is actually making me feel a bit <strong>peckish</strong>.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong><strong>Peckish</strong> is a great word isn’t it – it’s a slang word for being a bit hungry. Feeling peckish, Dan?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>I am now. Now, about you and your sandwiches Neil. Two slices of bread with filling might be the most popular British lunch choice, but it didn’t use to be that way. Listen to food writer Bee Wilson. Which adjective does she use to describe sandwiches?</p><p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Bee Wilson, Author<br/></strong>They were what you had in an emergency. They were what you had on a long train journey. It was a kind of <strong>makeshift</strong> lunch when you couldn’t get anything better.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>So – sandwiches had humble origins as <strong>makeshift</strong> meals. <strong>Makeshift</strong> describes something temporary and low quality – a solution you create when you can’t do anything better.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I can’t help feel this is all getting a little personal, Dan.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>There’s a sometimes very practical reason to eat a sandwich – like on a train. On a weekday in the office though, there’s no excuse.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>If you worked as hard as I did, Dan – you’d only have time for a sandwich!</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Which is just what Bee Wilson was saying – we treat lunchtime as if it were an emergency. It says something about our attitude to work and food in the UK. Next, let’s hear from philosopher Julian Baggini with his view on eating the same thing every day.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And let’s teach one more word first – <strong>utilitarian</strong>. It describes something practical and useful, rather than attractive.</p><p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Julian Baggini, Philosopher<br/></strong>What lunch says about us is that we’re still very much stuck in this kind of quite functional, you know, efficient, <strong>utilitarian</strong> attitude of how we should construct our daily lives; and that for all our <strong>embrace</strong> of this great food culture and everything, we haven’t managed to make that an everyday thing – it remains something for the special occasions.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So – he thinks we live in a world where we value being efficient – where we have a functional, <strong>utilitarian</strong> attitude to life.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Exactly, we’re aware of a great food culture, we <strong>embrace </strong>this culture – but only for special occasions.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes – let’s look at that word <strong>embrace</strong>. It normally means this… let me just…</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Oh Neil, I didn’t know you cared. Neil just hugged me, wrapped his arms around me, <strong>embraced</strong> me.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Just as we can <strong>embrace</strong> physical things and people – we can also <strong>embrace</strong> ideas.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Here’s an idea I <strong>embrace</strong>, Neil. We should all <strong>embrace</strong> new foods. <strong>Broaden our horizons</strong>.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>To <strong>broaden our horizons</strong> means 'to open our minds and experience new things'.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Let me <strong>broaden your horizons</strong> right now. Experts from Cornell University say it leads to better <strong>team spirit</strong> if colleagues eat together.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>OK, I get the picture. I should ditch my sandwich and eat with you. In the name of <strong>team spirit</strong> – that is – getting on well with team members – having a feeling of belonging.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Finally. Vietnamese?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Oh yes, but not before you tell me the answer to today’s question. How long do Brits take for lunch?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Well the answer was c) 25 minutes. That comes from a survey done by the BBC this year to find out about our modern dining habits.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>25 minutes? It’s a crying shame, Dan. But before we have lunch ourselves, let’s run over the vocab one more time.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>First up we had <strong>peckish</strong>. It means 'hungry – just a little hungry'. I’m feeling rather <strong>peckish</strong> at the moment, you?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I think I’ve gone beyond <strong>peckish</strong>, Dan. Roll on lunch. Next?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>We had <strong>makeshift</strong> – which describes a temporary or low quality solution.

I'm Dan…</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And I'm Catherine. In this programme we'll be discussing mermaids, as well as teaching you 6 new items of vocabulary, of course<em>…</em></p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>How would you like to be a mermaid?</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>A half-human and half-fish? Well, Dan, I think it's all a myth.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Well, then you'll find this week's question a bit of a difficult one to answer.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>I suppose I will. Go on then.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>When did the most recent <strong>alleged</strong> mermaid sighting take place? Was it a) the 1400s b) 1800s or c) 2000s?</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Ok, and by <strong>alleged, </strong>you mean 'said or believed to be true but not proven'. I don't believe in mermaids, but I think there's a lot of people who do, so I will say c) the 2000s.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Well, we'll find out if you're right a bit later on. So, what do you know about mermaids, Catherine?</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Well, a mermaid is a creature that's similar in appearance to a woman but instead of legs, a mermaid has the tail of a fish. The males are called mermen, and they live in the ocean. I thought they were a myth.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>They certainly appear to be mythical. They feature in legends and stories from all over the world. The earliest known one in a story dates from ancient Assyria, around 1000 BC. Can you think of a more modern example?</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Many people will be familiar with the Disney story, 'The Little Mermaid'.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Yes. Before it was an animated movie, it was a renowned fairy-tale written by Hans Christian Andersen, first published in 1837. Interestingly, a small bronze statue of the little mermaid has been sitting in Copenhagen in Denmark since 1913.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>There you go! There's no real evidence.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>What if I told you that over 200 mermaids have recently gathered in Greensboro, North Carolina in the USA?</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>You're telling me fish tales, Dan</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Ok. I'll confess. They aren't real mermaids. Each person is a normal human wearing a waist-high latex tail. They meet to share an interest in aquatic mythology, take underwater photos, and swim. For many of them, it's a source of income too! Listen to Daniel Craig, five year merman, explain.</p><p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Daniel Craig, merman<br/></strong>A lot of the mermaids we have attending here are professional mermaids. They will entertain at birthday parties, social events, company events. I <strong>stumbled across</strong> the mermaiding community merely by accident.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>So it's a job too! A professional merman. And Daniel said that he <strong>stumbled across</strong> it, or 'found it by accident'. So, it doesn't really count then though, does it Dan?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>A real, real mermaid? <strong>That's a different</strong> <strong>kettle of fish</strong>, which is an idiomatic phrase that means 'a completely different matter or issue'. Well, while we have no hard evidence, such as a photo of a real mermaid, there have been several sightings. One of the more recent ones was in 2009 in Haifa Bay.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Hang on now, that rings a bell! That's in Israel, isn't it? And it <strong>allegedly</strong> appeared at sunset. Apparently the mermaid was doing tricks.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>There you go then!</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>But there is no reason, Dan, to believe that it was anything other than a <strong>hoax,</strong> which means 'a deception or lie – often done for humour or sometimes cruelty'. Well, real or not, it could be fun to be a mermaid. I wonder what it would be like?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Well, that I can help with. Let Daniel Craig explain why he likes it so much.</p><p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Daniel Craig, merman<br/></strong>It's just <strong>serene</strong>. It's the perfect place for a temporary <strong>getaway</strong>.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>So he likes it because it's <strong>serene</strong>, which means 'calm and peaceful'.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Yes and he says it's the perfect <strong>getaway</strong>, which is 'a place you go in order to escape from normal life'.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Well, I still don't believe in mermaids, but I do believe, Dan, that you asked me a question.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/> </strong>I definitely did. I asked, when did the most recent <strong>alleged</strong> mermaid sighting take place? Was it a) the 1400s b) 1800s or c) 2000s?</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And I said I think it was the 2000s</p><p><strong>Dan<br/> </strong>And you have hit the nail on the head. Well done.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Thank you</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>You're right. It was the 2000s. It was in 2012 in Zimbabwe and it was reported by the water resource minister. Let's take a look at the vocabulary from this programme. Our first word was <strong>alleged</strong>. If something is <strong>alleged</strong> it is 'said or believed be true but not proven to be true'. Can you think of a recent example, Catherine?</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/> </strong>US President Donald Trump has alleged that newspapers have been printing fake news, but apparently there's no proof. And our next one was <strong>stumbled across</strong>. So, if you <strong>stumble across </strong>something you 'encounter or find it by accident'. It's a phrasal verb and you could also say come across. So, Dan, have you ever <strong>stumbled across</strong> anything unusual?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Well, there was a time when I was going to a party in Holborn and I got completely lost. And there on the floor in front of me I <strong>stumbled across</strong> a map of London. It got me straight to the party.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Spooky.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>The next one after that was <strong>a different kettle of fish. A different kettle of fish </strong>is an idiomatic phrase which means 'a completely different matter or issue'. You could also use the phrase 'a horse of a different colour'. </p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Next up, we had <strong>hoax</strong>. And a <strong>hoax</strong> is 'a deception or lie – which is often done for humour or cruelty'. What was the last hoax you did, Dan?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>One Christmas I wrapped a broken lightbulb in a box and gave it to mother as a present. I pretended to drop it and the broken lightbulb made a glass shattering noise and she thought that I had broken her present. After that we heard <strong>serene</strong>. <strong>Serene</strong> means 'calm and peaceful'. The noun is serenity. What's your idea of serene, Catherine?</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/> </strong>Two weeks, lying on the beach, drinking lemonade, listening to the sound of the sea. Fabulous. And finally we had a<strong> getaway. </strong>A<strong> getaway</strong> is an informal word meaning 'a place you go in order to escape from normal life', such as a holiday. So, where's your favourite getaway, Dan?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/> </strong>My favourite <strong>getaway </strong>is my yoga class. I find it really, really refreshing. Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

In this programme we'll be discussing life expectancy, as well as teaching you 6 new items of vocabulary, of course<em>…</em></p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>ZZZZzzzzzzz...</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Dan? Dan! We're doing a show, Dan. Wake up!</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Sorry. Sorry, Catherine. Sorry, everybody. I was at a party last night and I didn't get much sleep.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Another party, Dan?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Yeah.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>That's the third this week! You look <strong>dead on your feet</strong>, which is an expression meaning 'extremely tired.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Ah well. Live fast, die young. That's my <strong>motto</strong>.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>A <strong>motto</strong> is a short phrase which reflects the beliefs of an organisation or person.  And it's interesting that you mention dying young, Dan, because our topic this show is <strong>life expectancy</strong>.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong><strong>Life expectancy</strong> is how many years a person is likely to live. I suppose you have a question about it too?</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Funny you should say that, Dan. By the year 2030, will the USA's life expectancy be a) in the top third b) the middle third or c) the bottom third compared to the rest of the world?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>The USA is quite a rich country, so I'm going to say a) the top one third.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And we'll find out later in the show if you're right or not. Now, Dan, life expectancy, so which country do you think has the current highest life expectancy?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Everybody knows that's Japan, come on!</p><p><strong>Catherine</strong><br/> Aha, yes, but new analysis by the World Health Organization and Imperial College London predicts that it won't always be so. Now, they analysed 35 industrialised countries and found that by the year 2030 South Korea will be the leaders – with an average <strong>life expectancy</strong> of a whopping 90 years!</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Wow. How did they do that?</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Well, let's find out by listening to Professor Majid Ezzati, Chair in Global Environmental Health at Imperial College London.</p><p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Professor Majid Ezzati, Chair in Global Environmental Health at Imperial College London<br/></strong>It seems to be actually dealing with diet better than other places, being very good at taking up new medical knowledge technology and using it and, perhaps most importantly, doing this in a relatively <strong>equitable</strong> way compared to western countries.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>So, basically, good diet, using new medical technology and knowledge, and being more <strong>equitable</strong> – or fair and impartial – in society.  So how did the UK do?</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Well, not too well actually. We were thoroughly beaten by our closest neighbour, France.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>What!? How comes!?</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>I'll let Professor Majid Ezzati explain that too.</p><p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Professor Majid Ezzati, Chair in Global Environmental Health at Imperial College London<br/></strong>So France has had some of the lowest <strong>obesity</strong> rates among western countries, French women especially. UK has had some of the highest ones. And alcohol in France, at least until now, has been consumed… it’s much more healthy patterns, and in the UK there has been a lot more <strong>binge </strong>drinking.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>So, France has low <strong>obesity</strong>, which is a state of being very overweight, compared to the UK's high <strong>obesity</strong>.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/> </strong>And France drinks alcohol much more moderately than the UK, which tends to <strong>binge</strong>.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong><strong>Binging</strong> is when you consume a large amount of something in a short time - especially food or alcohol. So, confession time, Dan! How many drinks did you have last night?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/> </strong>It was only orange juice, I swear! So, come on. Did I get the question right? You asked me by the year 2030, will the USA's life expectancy be a) in the top one-third b) the middle one-third or c) the bottom third compared to the rest of the world? And I said the USA's quite a rich country, so it's probably a) in the top one-third.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Sorry Dan. Nice logic, but actually the USA is one of the least <strong>equitable</strong> places in the world. So their life expectancy suffers, and the answer was actually c) the bottom third.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Oh, well. Next week, maybe. Now, let's take a look at the vocabulary from this programme. First we had <strong>dead on your feet</strong>. This is an informal expression which means 'extremely tired'. Another way to say the same thing would be 'shattered'. When was a time when you were <strong>dead on your feet</strong>, Catherine?</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/> </strong>I built some garden furniture quite recently, and it took me all day, and I was <strong>dead on my feet</strong> when I finished. Now, we had <strong>motto. </strong>Now, a <strong>motto</strong> is a short phrase which reflects the beliefs of an organisation or person. So, Dan, what's your personal <strong>motto</strong>?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/> </strong>'Take the path of least resistance'. What about you?</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>'Less is more'.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Ah! Good one. Then we had <strong>life expectancy. </strong><strong>Life expectancy</strong> is how many years a person is likely to live. What do you think's a good <strong>life expectancy</strong> for a person?</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>I'm hoping to get to about 85 and then I’d like a, sort of, quick exit because I think it's probably not much fun after that. Then we had <strong>equitable</strong>. <strong>Equitable </strong>means 'being fair or impartial' and it comes from the word 'equal'. So, Dan, personal question. Would you say that your marriage is <strong>equitable</strong>?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>I'd like to think so, yes. I do the cooking, my wife does the cleaning, and we share the other jobs.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>We'll have to get Mrs. Dan in to give her opinion.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>After that we heard <strong>obesity</strong>. <strong>Obesity</strong> describes a state of being very overweight. It's a medical term and is often used in connection with health problems. The report said that the UK has an <strong>obesity</strong> problem, Catherine. How do you think we can solve it?</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/> </strong>I think we need a sugar tax and everybody should walk to work. Finally we had <strong>binge</strong>. To <strong>binge</strong> is to consume a large amount of something in a short space of time, especially something that you don't usually have. And these days we hear a lot about <strong>binge drinking, binge eating </strong>and<strong> binge watching</strong>. So, Dan, when did you last <strong>binge watch</strong> a series on TV?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/> </strong>Oh, it's Game of Thrones, isn't it? Series one, series two, series three. Back to back.</p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Back to back <strong>binging</strong>. Brilliant.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>That's it. Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

I'm Dan…</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I'm Neil. In this programme we'll be discussing armed police, as well as teaching you six new items of vocabulary, of course<em>. </em> </p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Can we get this done quickly today Neil? Only I've got to <strong>shoot off</strong> to a party later.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong><strong>Shoot off</strong> meaning leave quickly. Of course we can. And it's funny that you should mention shooting because our topic this week is gun control without guns.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Is that so? I have a question about that for you.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong><strong>Fire away</strong> then.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong><strong>Fire away</strong>, an expression giving permission for someone to ask a question or speak. So, which country has the oldest gun control laws in the world? Is it a) USA, b) Iceland or c) Japan?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I'm going to guess b) Iceland, just because I've never been there.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Well, we'll find out if you're right a bit later on. Now, imagine the scene. You are a police officer who has been called out to deal with an incident. When you arrive on scene you find a dangerous criminal. Do you reach for a gun, or a blanket?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>It's got to be a gun.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Well, in most countries in the world you'd be right, but not in Japan. Despite carrying guns, Japanese police almost never use them. Instead they rely on a combination of martial arts and in many cases where a person is violent, they bring out the futon – which is a kind of blanket – and they wrap them up and <strong>restrain </strong>them, or prevent them from moving. </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>You're pulling my leg.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Nope! Listen to Japanese journalist Anthony Berteaux describe the situation: </p><p><strong>INSERT</strong><br/> <strong>Anthony Berteaux, Japanese Journalist<br/></strong>What most Japanese police will do is to get huge futons and essentially roll up the person who is being violent or drunk into a little burrito and carry them back to the station, and calm them down. The response to violence is never violence, it's always to <strong>de-escalate</strong> it.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So, they safely <strong>restrain</strong> the person and wait for the situation to <strong>de-escalate</strong>, or become less intense.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Unless a criminal has a gun, Japanese police never fire their weapons.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Surely that means that the criminals always have the advantage then?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>You'd think so, but no. It seems that guns don't really feature in crimes much in Japan.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, that's astonishing. So do you think the criminals don't carry guns because the police don't carry guns or that the police don't carry guns because the criminals don't carry guns?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Wow, that makes my head hurt! Well I don't know, but listen to what Iain Overton, the Executive Director of Action on Armed Violence says about armed police in society.</p><p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Iain Overton, the Executive Director of Action on Armed Violence <br/></strong>The American model has been '<strong>militarise</strong> the police', but the challenge I have is that there is very little evidence that a more militarised police results in a more peaceful society.And I'm very concerned that if you have too many police pulling out guns at the first incidence of crime then you lead to a miniature <strong>arms race</strong> between police and criminals.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So, America tends to <strong>militarise</strong> its police meaning to equip them and use them as an army…</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>…and that causes an <strong>arms race</strong> with the criminals, which is a competition between two groups to have more weapons than the other group. </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>He also said that there's not a strong connection between armed police and a peaceful society. So, does that mean that Japanese society is more peaceful?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Well, violent crime still happens there, but criminals tend to carry other weapons, such as swords and knives, but at least it's a step in the right direction. Now, can you remember the quiz question I asked?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I think so. You asked me which country has the oldest gun control laws in the world? Is it a) USA, b) Iceland or c) Japan? And I said b) Iceland.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Well, I'm sorry Neil, that's not right. But, don't shoot the messenger, OK? It's Japan, which implemented its gun control laws in 1685.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>How interesting. Now, let's take a look at the vocabulary from this programme.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Sure, we had <strong>shoot off</strong>. If you <strong>shoot off</strong>, it means you leave somewhere in a hurry. What type of verb is it Neil? Can you give us an example?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>It's a phrasal verb so it's used conversationally and usually in an informal context. As for an example, when he heard his wife was sick, <strong>he shot off to the hospital</strong>. Synonyms could be dash off or run off. Next we had <strong>fire away. </strong>Now,<strong> fire away</strong> is an expression giving permission for someone to ask a question or speak. Can you think of any other ways to say the same thing, Dan, if I said, can I ask you a question?</p><p><strong>Dan</strong><br/> I'd say yes, of course, go ahead, please do, or by all means. <strong>Restrain. </strong>If you <strong>restrain</strong> someone, you prevent them from moving. In another sense, you might <strong>restrain</strong> yourself from doing something – for example: eating chocolate! Have you ever had to <strong>restrain</strong> your children from anything, Neil?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I have to <strong>restrain</strong> my children all the time, Dan, otherwise they would fight like mad. I have to pull them apart and <strong>restrain</strong> them. OK, <strong>de-escalate </strong>–If something <strong>de-escalates</strong>, it becomes less intense. This is often used in the context of conflicts or argument. Can you think of a historical example, Dan?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Well, in the 1960s the Cuban missile crises <strong>escalated</strong> over a period of two weeks and <strong>de-escalated</strong> only after diplomatic negotiations were successful. But it was pretty close to World War 3 at one point! <strong>Militarise. </strong>If something is <strong>militarised</strong>, it is equipped and used like an army. Give me an example of people who have become <strong>militarised</strong>, Neil.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>Yes, when I was a student in the United Kingdom some of the foreign students had to go home to take part in national service – that's join the army for a couple of years – so they became <strong>militarised</strong>. Now, an <strong>arms race.  </strong>An <strong>arms race</strong> is a competition between two groups to gain more weapons than the other group. Got an example of that, Dan?<br/> <strong><br/> Dan<br/> </strong>The most famous example of this is the Cold War. Both the USSR and the USA became involved in an <strong>arms race</strong> to stockpile as many nuclear weapons as possible. Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

In this programme we'll be discussing romance, as well as teaching you 6 new items of vocabulary, of course<em>.</em> Now, Dan, why are you looking so upset?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Oh Neil, it's all over! She broke up with me on Valentine's Day! She said I wasn't the one.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Cheer up Dan, cheer up. It's not your fault.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>No?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>You can blame romanticism.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Romanticism? What's that?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Romanticism was a <strong>movement</strong> that started in Europe and spread worldwide. It influenced literature, art, poetry, music and the way people behaved.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>A <strong>movement</strong> meaning 'a group of people working together to support an idea'?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes. And that bring us on to this week's question. When was the start of the romantic period? Was it a) the beginning of the 18th century, b) the middle of the 18th century or c) the end of the 18th century?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Well, I honestly have no idea, so I'm going to go smack in the middle… the middle of the 18th century.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And we'll find out later on in the show if you got the question right. Now, going back to your ex-girlfriend, let me take a wild guess… love at first sight, was it?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Well… yes. What's your point?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, it's not your fault, Dan. The idea is romantic, and by that I mean it originated from the romantic era. It was part of the <strong>zeitgeist</strong>, and many of these ideas still continue today.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong><strong>Zeitgeist</strong> - the word comes from German and literally means 'the spirit of the time'.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>A lot of what we believe about love today – for example, the idea that two people will live happily ever after - comes from the romantic period.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>But, everyone loves a bit of romance!</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, that's true. However, it's one thing to enjoy romance, but it can be dangerous to judge your relationship against romantic ideals.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>True, it might not be a realistic <strong>benchmark</strong>, and by that I mean 'a standard from which other things are judged'. So we grow up hearing these romantic stories, which leads us to develop an idea of what a relationship is meant to be… and then we get disappointed by the real thing?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, to put it bluntly, yes. The romantic ideal is just that – an <strong>idealised</strong> version, or perfect version, of a relationship. But it often leaves out the <strong>nitty-gritty</strong>, meaning 'practical details'. Details like work, stress, children… all of the things that we have to deal with in everyday life.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Not to mention, the fact that everyone is <strong>flawed</strong>, or imperfect, in their own way. That means we get angry or moody or upset for all sorts of reasons.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Exactly! Many popular love stories end at the point where the characters get together or marry. But very few show us how to keep that someone special over a long period of time. A relationship is hard work. </p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>And if the relationship you are in isn't as perfect as the story said it should be, then maybe you're with the wrong person, which could explain why so many marriages end in divorce. I wonder if that's true for other people's relationships. Fortunately, I found some people with partners and asked them.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, I asked these people about theirs…</p><p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Vox Pops<br/></strong>Is your partner 100% perfect for you?<br/>No.<br/>Not 100%.<br/>No, I don't think that's true.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Does that mean true love doesn't exist?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>No. It just means that all relationships must be worked on and that perfection is impossible. But we should never give up trying.  </p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>You're right! She wasn't the one for me! I need to find my next Juliet. She'll be just perfect!</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Oh Dan. You haven't learnt anything! You're just a hopeless romantic. Now, can you remember the quiz question? I asked you when the Romantic period originated: was it a) the beginning of the 18th century, b) the middle of the 18th century or c) the end of the 18th century?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>And I said: the middle of the 18th century.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Wrong I'm afraid! It was towards the end of the 18th century.</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>I have nothing good in my life at the moment.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>Shall we take a look at the vocabulary too?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Sure. The first word we had was <strong>movement </strong>- a <strong>movement</strong> is 'a group of people working together to support an idea'. Can you think of any modern day movements, Neil?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>The environmental <strong>movement</strong> is very strong and popular at the moment, as is the <strong>movement</strong> for equality – gender equality, for example. And the next word we had was <strong>zeitgeist </strong>- now, a zeitgeist literally means 'the spirit of a particular time'. What would you say that the <strong>zeitgeist</strong> is these days, Dan?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Well, I think there's a focus on personal freedom. There's environmental concern, and of course, let's not forget the rise of social media. The next word we had was <strong>benchmark</strong> – a <strong>benchmark</strong> is 'a standard from which other things are judged'. If you were looking for a new house, Neil, what would your <strong>benchmark</strong> be?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, my current house has a garden and it has somewhere I can park my car, so that would be the <strong>benchmark</strong> for a new house. It would have to have that at least, and more. Next we have <strong>idealised </strong>– an <strong>idealised</strong> thing is 'an often imagined, perfect version of something'. Now, what three things would exist in an <strong>idealised</strong> world for you then, Dan?</p><p><strong> Dan</strong><br/> I would say, personal freedom, religious tolerance and free ice-cream for everybody on a daily basis.<br/> <br/> <strong>Neil<br/></strong>Brilliant! Ok!</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Next we have <strong>nitty-gritty </strong>– the <strong>nitty-gritty</strong> is 'the important or practical detail involved in a situation or thing'. Now, getting married is supposed to be a wonderful thing, but what about the <strong>nitty-gritty</strong> of the ceremony, Neil. Give us a few examples!</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, you have to decide who's going to sit next to who, who to invite, the food  -  some people don't like this, some people don't like that. You've got to get the flowers right. Oh, there's so much to think about – makes you think that marriage might be <strong>flawed</strong>… and <strong>flawed</strong> is a thing which is 'imperfect in some way'. London's a great city, but how do you feel about it, Dan?</p><p><strong>Dan<br/></strong>Well, I think it's <strong>flawed</strong> in the way that the public transport could use an upgrade- there's never enough space on the carriages. Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English. Please join us again soon!</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And we are on social media too.

I'm Catherine…<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I'm Neil.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>So, Neil, do you notice anything different about me today?<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Have you done your hair differently?<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>No.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Is that a new outfit?<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Honestly, Neil!<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I give up. I don't know what's different about you.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>OK. Well, maybe by the end of the show you'll have figured it out. Anyway, today we're discussing memory and whether we can remember things accurately. So are you ready to answer today's quiz question, Neil?<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I am.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>OK. So in which part of the brain is there an area dedicated to remembering faces? Is it…<br/>a) the temporal lobe?<br/>b) the hypothalamus?<br/>or c) the cerebellum?<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, I have no idea. But I'll say a) the temporal lobe.<br/><strong><br/> Catherine<br/></strong>OK and we'll find out whether you chose the correct answer later on in the show. But let's talk more about how our memories can play tricks on us. We tend to think of memory as being like a video recorder that we can replay and recall again and again as it originally occurred. But memory doesn't work like that. It's a reconstructive process.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>A reconstructive process?<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Yes. We <strong>reconstruct</strong> - or rebuild - memories, and during this process, they may be <strong>distorted</strong> – or changed – for different reasons. Let's listen to Tim Valentine, retired professor of psychology at Goldsmith's College at the University of London, talking about this.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>INSERT<br/> Tim Valentine, retired professor of psychology at Goldsmith's College, University of London <br/></strong>From all those TV dramas you've watched you'll be familiar with the forensic scenes of crimes officers wearing their paper suits and covering their shoes and their hair to make sure they don't introduce their DNA or physical traces onto the crime scene. So that in the same way anybody who has any interaction with a witness needs to make sure that they don't distort their memory.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So crime officers wear protective clothing at crime scenes so they don't contaminate it with their DNA.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>That's right. A <strong>crime scene</strong> is a place where a crime was committed. And <strong>contaminated</strong> means 'made impure through contact with an outside source'. So for example, if an officer touches something without gloves on, they introduce new information. And once this has happened, you can't get back to the original information.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Now, Tim Valentine says that when police officers talk to the witness of a crime, they might also introduce new information. And this could change the witness's memory of what happened.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Catherine<br/> </strong>And it isn't only police questioning that can distort memory. Other factors such as stress can affect your ability to recall events accurately. For example, if you're being held at knifepoint you are likely to be concentrating on the weapon rather than on your attacker's face. And <strong>at knifepoint </strong>means 'under threat of being stabbed'.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So why do we place so much importance on eyewitness accounts?<br/><br/><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Eyewitness accounts can sound very convincing in court – but in fact according to research, they are often unreliable. <span>Karen Newirth, senior attorney at the Innocence Project in New York,</span> explains this further.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>INSERT<br/></span></strong><strong><span>Karen Newirth, senior attorney at the Innocence Project, New York<br/></span></strong><span>First, I think it's sort of natural for people to want to believe that memory can be accurate. It's very disconcerting to think that we're going through life relying on our memories and then to learn how mistaken they can be - and how frequently. Second is that the testimony of eyewitnesses has become a very expected piece of criminal trial so jurors sort of anticipate it, look for it, and tend to believe it.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>So we like to trust in our ability to remember things accurately. And it's disconcerting to learn that memory is frequently inaccurate. And <strong>disconcerting</strong></span><span> means…</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>…it means 'confusing and a bit upsetting'.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Karen Newirth also says that people expect eyewitness<strong> testimony </strong>– or spoken statements – in court. Do you think that's true, Catherine?<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Yes – and it's the most commonly used evidence brought against criminal defendants in court, even though they are often inaccurate.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Are there any ways to improve accuracy?<span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong>Yes, there are. For example, in a police line-up you can prevent eyewitnesses receiving information from the officer giving instructions, which might influence their response.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, I see. Well, you didn't give anything away when you asked what was different about your appearance at the beginning of the show.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Yes, that's true, Neil. But I can now reveal to you that... I'm wearing glasses, Neil. I've lost my contact lenses!<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I don't know how I missed that. Because actually you do look, well, completely different with glasses.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Just a bit, yes. So, now we're running out of time, so let's move onto the answer to today's quiz question. Remember I asked: in which part of the brain is there an area dedicated to recognizing faces? Is it…<br/>a) the temporal lobe?<br/>b) the hypothalamus?<br/>or c) the cerebellum?<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I said a) the temporal lobe. Was I right?<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>You were indeed, Neil! Very well done, it was the correct answer!<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes!<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>The main part of the brain dedicated to recognising faces – called the Fusiform Face Area – is positioned in the temporal lobe, which can be found roughly in the area just behind your ears.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>Fascinating! Now, here are the words we learned today…<br/>reconstruct<br/>distorted<br/>crime scene<br/>contaminated<br/>at knifepoint<br/>disconcerting<br/>testimony<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>And that bring us to the end of today's 6 Minute English.

I'm Catherine…</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And I'm Neil. Do you know, Catherine, someone actually talked to me on the underground this morning!</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>No, really?</span><strong><span> </span></strong></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yeah.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Wow! I should perhaps point out that talking to someone you don't know on the Tube is quite unusual behaviour in London! So, Neil, what did they say?<br/><br/></span><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, they said what a lovely day it was, great to see the sun shining in London – something along those lines. But it was actually nice to chat instead of sitting there with a frown on my face, fiddling with my phone.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Which is what you probably always do to pass the time on public transport, Neil.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, it is - me and thousands of others. But it got me thinking… if it makes me feel better to talk to people on the way to work, why don't I – and other commuters in the city – do it more often?</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Well, that's a good question, Neil, and maybe we'll find some answers in the show, because today we're talking about why cities make us so rude.  </span><span>And I have a question for you: when we have a positive interaction with somebody, our body releases a chemical. But what's the name of this chemical? Is it…<br/></span><span>a) melatonin?<br/></span><span>b) oxytocin?<br/></span><span>Or c) thyroxin?</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>I don't know, but I'm going to say a) melatonin.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Well, we'll see if you were right or not later on in the show. But did you know, Neil, that an organisation called 'Talk to me London' has created these 'Tubechat' badges that you can wear to show that you're happy to talk to a stranger. Maybe you should get one! <br/></span><strong><br/><span> Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yeah, maybe I should. But the thing is, people in big cities are often scared to start a conversation with a stranger because, well, you don't know what might happen. </span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>That's true. Now, let's listen to Dr Elle Boag, a social psychologist at Birmingham City University here in the UK. She agrees that people can view cities as threatening places. </span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>INSERT<br/></span><span> </span></strong><strong><span>Dr Elle Boag, social psychologist, Birmingham City University in the UK<br/></span></strong><span>When we step off the metro or onto a crowded city street our brain becomes hyper vigilant to the perception of threats around us – we're just one small person in a very large set of other people, in a large body of people. This then leads to behaviours that are insular and defensive. We're persistently looking for potential threats around us, and this then makes us not give eye contact, this will reduce the likelihood that anybody will say hello. It's a protective mechanism by which we can survive our journey to whence we're going, which makes us all sound really really rude to one other.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Dr Elle Boag there. And <strong>hyper vigilance</strong></span><span> means being extremely watchful of what's going on around you. People can behave unpredictably, and like Dr Boag says, you're just one person in a crowd of others and you just don't know who might be dangerous.<br/><br/></span><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yeah, I see what you mean. And the fact we are constantly on the lookout for potential threats, well, it affects our behaviour.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>That's right. And as a protective mechanism we avoid speaking to or making eye contact with other people. So we become <strong>insular</strong></span><span> – which means inward looking. </span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>It sounds awful! But actually, I know people who moved to London in order to be anonymous – to blend in with the crowd – and not have to talk to people!</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Well, if you grow up in a small town, it can feel <strong>claustrophobic</strong></span><span> – which means not having enough space to feel comfortable. You know, you can't do anything without the whole community knowing about it. You may have nosey neighbours.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And a <strong>nosey</strong></span><span> person shows too much interest in other people's business. </span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Now, it's good to point out that people living in cities have stuff to do. And it's not necessarily rudeness that stops people from chatting – it's about efficiency – getting to work on time, getting things done. Let's hear from Thomas Farley, writer and broadcaster, and expert on manners, for more on this. </span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>INSERT<br/></span><span> </span></strong><strong><span>Thomas Farley, writer and broadcaster<br/></span></strong><span>The cost of living in cities is higher, the success quotient is higher, it's a place where you hustle to survive, and if you are not hustling, and I mean that literally and figuratively, you are not able to survive and thrive. So we often don't have much time for chitchat. I think we just all need to be mindful that it's not a deliberate disregard or somebody trying to be rude on purpose – it's simply that people have a destination to be.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>So what does Thomas Farley mean by success quotient, Catherine?</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span><strong>Success quotient</strong> means your ability to be successful in work, relative to the average person, and Thomas Farley is saying that in cities people have higher success quotients.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Cities are also competitive places so people have to hustle to survive. Do we hustle, Catherine?</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>I don't think we hustle, Neil. <strong>Hustle</strong></span><span> means to work aggressively to make money. </span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>We do have plenty of time for chitchat, though. And <strong>chitchat</strong></span><span>, by the way, means unimportant conversation. That's what we do!</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>What we do isn't chitchat, Neil! It's highly informative and instructional! Now, I think it must be time to hear the answer to today's quiz. Do you remember, I asked: when we have a positive interaction with someone, our body releases a chemical. What's the name of this chemical? Is it…<br/><br/></span><span>a) melatonin?<br/></span><span>b) oxytocin?<br/></span><span>Or c) thyroxin?</span></p><p><span> </span><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And it's a) melatonin – I'm absolutely sure.</span></p><p><span> </span><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Sorry! The correct answer is b) oxytocin – a hormone commonly known as the 'love drug'. It reduces fear, increases trust between people, and evokes feelings of contentment. </span></p><p><span> </span><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Now, here are the words we learned today:<br/></span><span>hyper vigilance<br/></span><span>insular<br/></span><span>claustrophobic<br/></span><span>nosey<br/></span><span>quotient<br/></span><span>hustle<br/></span><span>chitchat</span></p><p><span> </span><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>That's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

You know, where celebrities find out about their family history?</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Yeah, I've seen a couple of them. For example, one celebrity – who was very proud of his working class London <strong>roots</strong></span><span> – or origins – discovered that he's actually a direct descendent of an English king!</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, that's quite a discovery! The thing is though, Catherine, what if there isn't anything exciting in your family history – no mysteries, no skeletons in the closet…</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Well, I reckon if you go back far enough Neil, there's always something exciting or unexpected in anybody's family history. And <strong>skeletons in the closet</strong></span><span> by the way, means secrets! Now, I think it's time for today's quiz question. Researching family history often involves reading old documents such as birth, marriage and death certificates, and these can be difficult to </span><strong><span>decipher</span></strong><span> – or understand. So what's the name for the study of ancient handwriting? Is it…<br/></span><span>a) Scriptography?<br/></span><span>b) Palaeography?<br/></span><span>Or c) Scribology?</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, it must be a) Scriptography.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And we'll see if you're right or not later on in the show. Now, why do you think most people look into their genealogy, Neil? Is it just curiosity? </span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, Catherine, we all love a good mystery story – especially if it's connected with our own family. And these days, it's easy to do research online because many old paper documents have been digitised and are available online.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>BBC presenter Mike Williams investigated his own family history. And here, he's talking about his great-grandfather's story. And if you listen carefully you can hear him rustling the real paper documents!</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong>INSERT<br/> </strong><strong>Mike Williams, BBC presenter<br/></strong>The Williamses are my father's side and on my mother's the Heino's – it's a name that we think comes from Finland. If I look at this document here – it's a copy of the census of England and Wales 1911 - you can see my grandfather, the son, and his father – the head of the household – Michael Heino, or Michel Heino, who, the family law has it, jumped ship and ended up in Liverpool. </p><p><strong><span data-mce-mark=""1"">Neil<br/></span></strong><span data-mce-mark=""1"">What's a <strong>census</strong></span><span data-mce-mark=""1"">, Catherine?</span><span data-mce-mark=""1""><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>It's an official count of people in a population. So Mike Williams's great grandfather appeared on the 1911 census for England and Wales but because of his surname the family think he might originally have come from Finland.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span><span> </span></strong><span>The exciting event in Mike Williams' history – passed down through <strong>family lore</strong></span><span> – which means 'knowledge passed on from one generation to the next' – is that his great-grandfather </span><span>jumped ship</span><span>.<br/><br/></span><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Which means he left the ship he was working on without permission to do so. </span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And he started a new life in England. I suppose quite a few people have immigration stories in their family histories – sometimes without knowing it. </span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Actually that's something that many people are fascinated by – and has also become easier to investigate these days now companies offer to test the DNA in your saliva for as little as a hundred dollars.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And then they come up with results saying you're related to Alexander the Great or Brad Pitt… Remember I said that we were related? Well, let's now listen to Else Churchill, from the Society of Genealogists here in London, who explains what I meant.</p><p><strong><span data-mce-mark=""1"">INSERT<br/></span><span data-mce-mark=""1""> </span></strong><strong><span data-mce-mark=""1"">Else Churchill, Society of Genealogists, London<br/></span></strong><span data-mce-mark=""1"">There's what you might call the 'gateway ancestor' – and the idea of history and genealogy is that's normally somebody that is so well documented that their descendants are well known – in England it's something like Edward III. And we're all probably descended from Edward III. Is it nice to have royal ancestors? Well, millions of people are descended from Edward III, and so in that sense, that's where the connection might be. So the chances are an awful lot of people are distantly connected to each other.</span><span data-mce-mark=""1""><br/></span></p><p><strong><span data-mce-mark=""1"">Catherine<br/></span></strong><span data-mce-mark=""1"">Else Churchill says it's likely that millions of us are distantly related to a gateway ancestor like King Edward III of England. And that means that all those people related to Edward III are also distantly related to each other. So it seems that paying a company a hundred dollars to reveal that you're related to Edward III is a waste of money.</span><span data-mce-mark=""1""><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, in the sense that it's you and millions of other people. And in fact, we're all related to each other somehow, via Edward III or someone else. </span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And another popular finding for British people is to say that you're descended from </span><span>the Vikings, and again this is true for many people so it isn't particularly meaningful.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>If you're <strong>descended from</strong></span><span> a person or a group it means they are among your ancestors. </span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Now, remember I asked: what's the name for the study of ancient handwriting? Is it…<br/></span><span>a) Scriptography?<br/></span><span>b) Palaeography?<br/></span><span>Or c) Scribology?</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>I said a) Scriptography. And I'm pretty confident that's the right answer.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Well, Neil, you're pretty confident but unfortunately it was wrong! The correct answer is b) Palaeography. Palaeography is the study of ancient and historical handwriting, including the practice of deciphering, reading, and dating historical manuscripts.</span><span><br/></span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Oh well, here are the words we learned:<br/></span><span>genealogy<br/></span><span>roots<br/></span><span>skeletons in the closet<br/></span><span>decipher<br/></span><span>census<br/></span><span>family lore<br/></span><span>descended from</span><span> </span></p><p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>And that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

It has also given rise to new theories about how and when life began. Neil and Alice discuss extremophile environments and how these differ from their own favourite places., 19 Jan 2017,"<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Alice…</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I'm Neil. So Alice, what's your ideal place to be?</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Curled up on the sofa with a good book in front of a log fire. Last night it was very cold. </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, for me, lying in a hammock under a palm tree on a tropical beach with a cool breeze. I don't like when it's too hot. </p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Yes, true. Humans don't cope well with extremes of temperature but some species do. The subject of today's show is <strong>extremophiles</strong> – these are microorganisms that have adapted to live in what we would consider to be extreme conditions. For example, living in near boiling acidic water or frozen at the bottom of an Antarctic lake.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Those do sound like pretty extreme conditions. </p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Yes. The thing is, what sounds <strong>hostile</strong> – or unfriendly – to us, are perfect environments for extremophiles and in fact they wouldn't survive without them. Now, are you tough enough to face up to today's quiz question, Neil?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I think so.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Alright then, here goes: which US National Park is home to <strong>geysers</strong> – or hot springs that shoot hot water and steam into the air – which have extremophiles living in them? Is it…<br/>a) Grand Canyon?<br/>b) Death Valley National Park?<br/>Or c) Yellowstone?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>That's easy - it has to be c) Yellowstone.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>OK, well we'll find out if you got the answer right later on in the show. But, moving on, now, Neil, did you know that extremophiles belong to an entirely different group of living things to other animals and plants?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>No. I imagined extremophiles would be like insects, because insects are pretty tough, aren't they?</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Yes, that's true. But remember, extremophiles are <strong>microorganisms</strong> – they're really tiny. Let's listen to Ian Crawford, Professor of Planetary Science and Astrobiology at Birkbeck University of London. He tells us how in the 1970s a scientist called Carl Woese identified a new kingdom of living things that he called 'archaea' – meaning 'ancient ones'. The extremophiles belong to this group.</p><p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Ian Crawford, Professor of Planetary Science and Astrobiology at Birkbeck University of London<br/></strong>Well, the old tree of life idea basically talked about empires if you like, of plants, and animals, and things that we can see, essentially. We put a great deal of emphasis on large organisms and the traditional distinction in biology between botany and zoology. What it really did was say 'that's all wrong – there's really only three major groups in life: there's the archaea, the bacteria, and the eukaryotes, which is all of this complex life'; and so it kind of put humans into a small corner of the tree of life next to plants and whatever else. It kind of squashes us again after being the centre of the universe.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So <strong>botany</strong> is the study of plant life, and <strong>zoology</strong> is the study of animal life. But maybe you can explain 'archaea', and 'eukaryotes', Alice.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong><strong>Archaea</strong> are a group of single-celled microbes similar to bacteria but different to all other known types. <strong>Eukaryote</strong> is the scientific term for organisms with a much larger and more complex type of cell– and this group includes all animals, plants, and fungi.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>But why are archaea so important? Why do they need a whole biological domain to themselves, while we humans get squashed up in one domain with plants and fungi?</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well, Neil, it's likely they've have been living on our planet ever since the Earth became habitable – and that's billions of years. And they are still living and thriving in a whole range of different environments today.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And when something is <strong>thriving</strong> it means it's doing well! So tell us about where they live, Alice.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Some live in <strong>hydrothermal vents</strong> – holes in the ocean floor hundreds of metres down where there's lots of pressure and no sunlight. And mineral-rich superheated water is coming out of the Earth's crust and then flowing out through these holes.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I see… Well, what about cold-loving extremophiles?</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well, scientists have found them in hidden lakes trapped beneath ice sheets hundreds of metres thick in Antarctica. It takes days to drill through the ice to reach the water.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And how do they survive down there?</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well, these microbes have found a way of getting energy from certain minerals like iron and sulphur present in the water.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>That sounds clever for a microbe – how did they figure that out?</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>It isn't a question of cleverness - it's a question of adaptation. Extremophiles are extremely well adapted to their environment and they appeared on Earth much earlier than more complex life forms. Let's hear from Nick Lane, Reader in Evolutionary Biochemistry at University College London.</p><p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Nick Lane, Reader in Evolutionary Biochemistry at University College London<br/></strong>The origin of the Eukaryotic cell, it seems to have happened once, it took about 2 billion years before that happened. Then there was kind of a great leap forward at the cellular level, but another billion years went by before we see animals.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So, basically, the animal kingdom is much newer than the archaean kingdom.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Indeed. And now it's time for the answer to today's quiz question, Neil. I asked: which US National Park is home to geysers that have extremophiles living in them? Is it… a) Grand Canyon, b) Death Valley National Park or c) Yellowstone?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I said c) Yellowstone. I must be right.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Yes, Neil, you are right - it's Yellowstone National Park. Every year, scientists discover remarkable new microbes in Yellowstone's hot springs, with implications for medicine, agriculture and energy, as well as offering clues to the formation of the earliest life on Earth.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Very interesting. Now, here are the words we heard today:<br/>extremophiles<br/>hostile<br/>geysers<br/>microorganisms<br/>botany<br/>zoology<br/>archaea<br/>eukaryote<br/>thriving<br/>hydrothermal vents</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>And that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

I'm Neil…</p><p><strong>Alice<br/> </strong>And I'm Alice. So Neil, the subject of today's show is superheroes! Who's your favourite?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Spiderman. He's cool and funny – and he can spin webs and jump off skyscrapers!<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well, my favourite superhero is Ms Marvel.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I've never heard of her – and I’m a bit on an expert on comic book superheroes.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well, a growing number of people from ethnic backgrounds are getting bored of all these white male superheroes they can’t relate to. And they're hungry for characters a little <strong>closer to home</strong> – or relevant to their own lives.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So what's Ms Marvel's super power?</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>She's a <strong>shape shifter</strong> – which means she can change shape and become anything she wants. But she's also just Kamala Khan, an average teenager from New Jersey, who happens to be Asian and a Muslim.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>It sounds good. But I think it must be time for today's quiz question, Alice!</p><p><strong>Alice<br/> </strong>OK, here it is. What is the name of the new character that replaces Tony Stark as Iron Man? Is it…<br/>a) Miles Morales?<br/>b) Riri Williams?<br/>Or c) Jane Foster?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I'm going to say a) Miles Morales because he sounds like a man.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well, we'll find out later on the show whether you got the answer right or not. Now, I have another question. What are the rules for achieving superhero status? Superman is an alien, Ms Marvel has alien genes, and Spiderman and the Hulk are both <strong>contaminated</strong> – or poisoned – by radioactive substances that change their DNA.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>What about Batman and Iron Man? They're just ordinary guys with a lot of money who use technology to create superpowers for themselves.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Good point. There don't seem to be any <strong>hard-and-fast</strong> – or clear – rules. But these special powers – whether it's being able to fly, or change shape, or spin webs – they allow the characters to do good in the world. And that’s a big theme across all comic books.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>That's true. But times have changed, and comic books these days often <strong>blur</strong> the line between right and wrong – making things unclear. Superheroes don’t always do the right thing and struggle with everyday problems like you and me.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Let's hear more about imperfect superheroes from Jason Ditmer, professor of political geography at University College London.</p><p><strong>INSERT<br/> </strong><strong><span>Jason Ditmer, professor of political geography at University College London<br/></span></strong><span>They [Marvel Comics] imbued these characters with real human problems. So Peter Parker had just, was sort of… one problem after another. The Fantastic Four was a family and they bickered and fought and Reed and Sue were a couple, and then they got married, and that had, like, never happened in superhero comics. So these people had lives that others could relate to. </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>So publishers – like Marvel Comics – <strong>imbued</strong></span><span> – or filled – their characters with human problems. I can't imagine a character like Captain America worrying about small things – or bickering with his wife!</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>And <strong>bickering</strong></span><span> means arguing about things that aren't important. Well, like you said earlier, times change, Neil. These days, the publishing houses want to attract a more </span><strong><span>diverse</span></strong><span> – or varied – readership: teenagers, women, ethnic minorities – who want superheroes they can relate to, facing issues from racial discrimination to bickering at home. </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>I know that women are indeed interested in superheroes because they've been appearing in movies and on TV, but the world of comic books has always been a bit of a guy thing.</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Well, it isn't. Women read them and in some places women work in them. In Japan for example, we have the <strong>manga</strong> – these are Japanese comic books for adults and children. And, guess what – there is a strong tradition of female illustrators there. </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Really?</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Yes. Let’s move on now and listen to Dr Casey Brienza, Sociologist at City University in London, talking about manga.</span></p><p><strong>INSERT<br/> </strong><strong><span>Dr Casey Brienza, Sociologist at City University in London<br/></span></strong><span>One of the really interesting things about producing comics in Japan is that it's one of the few, kind of, autonomous careers that women can have. And so Japan has many, many female comic-book artists who write both for men, women, boys, and girls. And in the United States and in Britain female comic-book artists are far and away a minority.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong>Dr Casey Brienza there. So she says female comic-book artists are common in Japan but are a minority in the US and the UK.<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>It's particularly interesting that being an artist is an <strong>autonomous</strong> career – meaning you have the freedom to make your own decisions - and apparently this is not common for women in Japan.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And do you know who draws Ms Marvel? Is it a woman?</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>No. Ms Marvel is drawn by a man – the Canadian comic book artist Adrian Alphona. But we are running out of time so let's go to today's quiz question. I asked you: what's the name of the new character that replaces Tony Stark as Iron Man? Is it…<br/>a) Miles Morales?<br/>b) Riri Williams?<br/>Or c) Jane Foster?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I said Miles Morales.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>And you were… wrong, Neil. I'm sorry. The answer is Riri Williams. Marvel Comics has recently diversified its characters to look more like the world we know today, including the addition of female African-American college student Riri Williams as Iron Man. Marvel has also given Thor's hammer to a woman, introduced a black, Hispanic Spider-Man called Miles Morales and created Kamala Khan, a Muslim superhero otherwise known as Ms Marvel.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Very interesting.

I'm Alice…</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I'm Neil. What do you think about autonomous cars, Alice?</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>An <strong>autonomous</strong> – or independent and driverless – car is a vehicle that is capable of sensing its environment and navigating without human input. I think they're a great idea.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And <strong>navigate</strong> means' to find the way to get to a place'. I'm not sure I would trust a computer to drive me. It might go wrong and crash into a wall.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Maybe, but actually most car accidents involve an element of human error, and <strong>human error</strong> means 'the mistakes we make because we're human'. For example, people who are behind the wheel while tired or drunk – or distracted.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong><strong>Behind the wheel:</strong> in other words, in control of a car. Yes, I often see people talking on their mobile phones – or texting – instead of looking at the road.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>They are being irresponsible drivers, Neil. Driving is the subject of today's show. I have a question for you. On average, how many people around the world die each day from road accidents? Is it…<br/><span data-mce-mark=""1"">a</span>) 300?<br/>b) 3,000?<br/>Or c) 30,000?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I'm going to say b) 3,000.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well, we'll see if you were right or not later on in the show. Are you a petrol head, Neil?<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>No, I'm not a <strong>petrol head</strong> – which is somebody who loves cars and driving. But I know Eddie Jordan, a racing team owner, is. And what does he love about driving? He'll answer this question himself. Let's listen.</p><p><strong>INSERT<br/> </strong><strong><span>Eddie Jordan, racing team owner<br/></span></strong><span>When I get in a car I feel a different person, I feel that I'm now in control. I can turn on the music or I can turn it off. I can do all sorts of different things that I feel good about. When I was flat out with the Jordan team I did have a driver and that was one to be able to make calls and to be able to receive calls and to be able to work in the car, not because I didn't want to drive and I always felt cheated because there was a driver there taking the pleasure that I should be having. So when I get in a car it has to be a fun experience.</span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Eddie Jordan there. And doing something <strong>flat out</strong> means 'at maximum capacity'. Do you feel like a different person when you're driving, Alice?</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>No. And – unlike Eddie Jordan – I'd love to have a driver or a driverless car, for that matter. It gives you time to do other things, like getting some work done. I certainly wouldn't feel cheated of the pleasure of driving!</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I agree with Eddie Jordan. I would feel a bit cheated. And I have to admit: I'm a bit of a <strong>backseat driver</strong>. I sit in the passenger seat and give the driver unwanted advice.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well just think, Neil, in a driverless car, you wouldn't need to give the computer advice because it would be making the right decisions to get you to your destination safely.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>But can you override the computer? You know, if you felt that it was making bad decisions?</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong><strong>Override</strong> in this context means 'to stop an automatic action by taking control yourself'. Airline pilots do that, don't they? They fly on autopilot for most of the journey, but override it in order to take control of the plane for take-off and landing.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I would feel happier if I could take back control of an automated car if I wanted to.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well, let's listen now to Brian Fung, a technology reporter, who's experienced what it is to be in a driverless car<span> that has no steering wheels, no brake pedals, no emergency brake, no gear shifter.

And the car knew how to stop for red lights; it knew how to run through yellow lights, it could detect pedestrians and navigate its way around parked cars. All in all, it felt very similar to a regular car-driving experience. And I think that's one of the most surprising and exciting things about it – it's how mundane it was.</span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Brian Fung says he noticed right off the bat that the Google car accelerated and braked more aggressively than a regular car – and <strong>right off the bat </strong>means 'immediately'.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>But he also says it took him only ten seconds to get used to it and feel comfortable, as the car navigated appropriately and responded to different traffic situations, including pedestrians and parked cars.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, that all sounds very nice, but I think I'd still prefer to be <strong>in the driving seat</strong> – and that means 'in control of a situation'. You can take the driverless car, and do your work, Alice.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well, the future is likely to be all about automated transport – planes, trains, buses, and cars – and you simply won't have a choice, Neil.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Maybe you'll be allowed to hire a car you can drive yourself, just for fun.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Maybe.

I'm Neil…</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>And I'm Alice.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So Alice how did you spend Saturday night?</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Curled up on the sofa with a good book. You?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I went out on the town. Met some friends, had a few drinks, then went on to a party.<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well that illustrates the difference between us – you're an extrovert. And I'm… not. And where we are on the spectrum between introvert and extrovert is the subject of today's show.<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So would you call yourself an introvert, Alice?</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>No, I'm an <strong>ambivert</strong>, which means a mixture of introvert and extrovert.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, whichever you are, Alice, staying in on your own on a Saturday night is pretty boring!</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Not to me. And you shouldn't be so judgemental, Neil. You're reflecting the general view that people seem to have these days, that being an introvert is somehow less valuable than being an extrovert. Introverts have many valuable qualities. They're <strong>reflective</strong> – that means thoughtful – and have <strong>inner resources</strong>. In other words, they don't rely on other people to enjoy themselves.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>OK, well if you're feeling reflective at the moment, how about answering today's quiz question?</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>OK.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Can you tell me: who first used the term 'extrovert'? Was it…<br/>a) Sigmund Freud?<br/>b) Friedrich Nietzsche?<br/>Or c) Carl Jung?</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>I think the answer is c) Carl Jung.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, we'll find out if you got the answer right or not later in the show. But before we get there, let's listen to Lisa Kaenzig, researcher and Associate Dean for William Smith College, New York State, telling us a bit more about what being an introvert typically means.</p><p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Lisa Kaenzig, researcher and Associate Dean for William Smith College, New York State<br/></strong>Introverts are people of any age who really get their energy from within themselves. And who often have sort of a running dialogue in their head going on thinking before they're talking, like to have a little more time to think through things before they're commenting on them or answering a question, need some time to recharge their batteries by being by themselves, and enjoy having alone time.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Lisa Kaenzig there – who says that introverts think about what they're going to say before they say it.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Do you do that, Neil?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Nope!</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>You should try it sometime. Now, Lisa also talks about the different ways people <strong>recharge their batteries</strong> – introverts tend to need time alone to regain their strength and energy when they're feeling <strong>drained</strong> – or very tired – whereas extroverts often prefer to recharge by being with other people.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So introverts create their energy internally – from within themselves – and extroverts recharge from being with other people.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Exactly. But in some situations, for example at school or in the workplace, things can be made suitable for – extroverts. Extroverts typically love being with others – in a big class or an open plan office – where there's a lot going on. They enjoy the external stimulation. But introverts can find these big, noisy environments uncomfortable.<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I can see that. And these days, people are wild about group work and brainstorming – job ads frequently ask if you are a people person, a team player … and so on.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>That's right. Introverts like to work alone or in small groups and need a quieter space to perform well. Let's listen now to Dr Peter Aloka, a researcher and psychologist in Kenya. He's been working with introvert teenage mothers in Bondo who are returning to school after having their babies. And schools are being asked to develop new strategies to support their learning.</p><p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Dr Peter Aloka, psychologist, Bondo, Kenya<br/></strong>Introverts might find it easier working in groups, but with smaller groups, and they work in pairs with extroverts… The teachers should design a classroom for all the students too, to contribute. Whenever a teacher is teaching a question in class let them allow for wait time for students to process the information before answering the question. Just for people to think through that question. Thinking, pairing, and sharing: those three strategies will help the introverts to speak out.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Dr Peter Aloka is talking about some very clever pairing there. If you put two introverts together they might not say anything. An extrovert is likely to talk, but won't <strong>intimidate</strong> – or overpower – their introvert partner as much as a large group would.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>So the idea is that with fewer people – in a small group or a pair – the introvert will have enough time and space to express their ideas. And because their ideas have been <strong>thought through</strong> – or carefully considered – , their contribution is likely to be worth waiting for. So… Think. Pair. Share.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Hmm. I like that. OK, so I think it's time to share the answer to today's quiz question. I asked: who first used the term ‘extrovert'? Was it…<br/>a) Sigmund Freud?<br/>b) Friedrich Nietzsche?<br/>Or c) Carl Jung?</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>I said… Carl Jung.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And you were… right, Alice. So thinking things through really works! ‘Introvert' and ‘extrovert' are the two basic personality types according to the theories of the 20th-century Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung. According to these theories, an introvert is a person whose interest lies with their own feelings and thoughts, in contrast to an extrovert, whose interest lies with other people and the outside world.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>OK. Now, let's hear the words we learned today:<br/>ambivert<br/>reflective<br/>inner resources<br/>recharge their batteries<br/>drained<br/>intimidate<br/>thought through</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, that's the end of this edition of 6 Minute English.

I'm Alice…</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I'm Neil.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Neil, what are you doing?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I saw Squirtle … And … I'm trying to catch it! </p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>What are you talking about?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong><em>Pokémon Go</em>, Alice. I'm trying to catch a Pokémon.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>What?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Alice! Keep up! <em>Pokémon Go</em> is a game where these little virtual monsters pop up onto your phone and you have to catch them. There it is again… Ha! Gotcha! I got Squirtle.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well done, Neil. Now the subject of today's show is crazes…</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>… and <em>Pokémon Go </em>is a good example. When it was first released, so many people were downloading the app that servers were crashing all over the place.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Perhaps I should explain at this point that a <strong>craze </strong>or a<strong> fad</strong> is a sudden and widespread enthusiasm for something, which only lasts a short time. So why do you think this craze for <em>Pokémon Go</em> took off, Neil?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>It uses augmented reality – and that's exciting new technology! It's fun to play outside – and the game was released over the summer when people want to be outside. And … people are already familiar with the monsters since they were created back in 1995.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong><strong>Augmented reality</strong> by the way, is where digital information is layered on top of what you see through a smartphone or other device, ‘augmenting' or adding to it.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I love this game. But then again, I loved other games in the past. I still have some toys and gadgets from my childhood at home. If there was a fad I would join in, I'm afraid.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well, let me test your knowledge about toys that turned into fads. Tell me: what is the best-selling toy of all time? Is it:<br/>a) the space hopper?<br/>b) the Rubik's cube also known as magic cube?<br/>Or c) the cabbage patch doll?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I'll say b) the Rubik's cube. I have one and, so do my cousin, my neighbour... my brother… my dog…</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well, we'll find out if you got the answer right or not later on in the show. But why do we like to participate in crazes? Dr Ben Michaelis, a clinical psychologist from Columbia University in the US, explains.</p><p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Dr Ben Michaelis, clinical psychologist and visiting scholar at Columbia University, US<br/></strong>When a person or a group perceives an idea or a process or a product as being beneficial to one person or to a group of people, they immediately want to experience that benefit for themselves, which hooks into an ancient evolutionary fear of being left behind or abandoned by our tribes, and so more people join in.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So Ben Michaelis believes that people join crazes because they are afraid of being abandoned by others in their group. But I don't think that's true for me – I just enjoy playing games!</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Yes, but why have you switched from <em>Angry Birds</em>, to <em>Minecraft</em>, to <em>Pokémon Go </em>in the space of a year? And before that there was Candy Crush and…</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, I get bored after a while.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>So it isn't because other people stop playing it? And they stop talking about it? And it stops being a group thing?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Hmm. Maybe there is an element of that. Anyway, I like the idea that we join a craze because it's <strong>beneficial</strong> – or good – for us.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>I'm not convinced that playing <em>Pokémon Go</em> is beneficial. Did you know, Neil, that in terms of personality type, people who are more emotionally insecure are far more likely to follow a craze? You know, sort of, herd mentality?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong><strong>Herd mentality</strong> describes how people are influenced by their peers to adopt certain behaviours. But it's fun to be connected with others through a craze. Aren't you troubled by FOMO?</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong><strong>FOMO</strong> – or fear of missing out? Oh no, I have a strong sense of self. But… well, I must admit I like loom bands. Do you remember those little rubber bands you could make jewellery and other stuff out of?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, I remember. David Beckham wore a loom band bracelet…</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>So did the Duchess of Cambridge. They were very popular a couple of years ago and came from a simple idea. Cheong Choon Ng, an immigrant from Malaysia living in the United States, invented the Rainbow Loom after watching his daughters play. Let's hear his story.</p><p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Cheong Choon Ng, inventor of the Rainbow Loom<br/></strong>The idea of loom band came from my daughters. So one day they came home from school. Two of them were teaching each other how to make rubber band bracelets from those small tiny ponytail size rubber bands. I tried to impress them by making a thicker bracelet that was made from a prototype loom that I fabricated. And it was a success. And they were telling me that 'those bracelets are so cool, can you make more?'</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Cheong Choon Ng made a <strong>prototype</strong> – a first model of a machine from which all others would develop. He posted a video of his daughters making the bracelets and these went viral on the internet.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Interesting. Now, I think it's time for the answer to today's quiz question.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Yes. I asked: what is the best-selling toy of all time? Is it: a) the space hopper, b) the Rubik's cube also known as magic cube, or c) the cabbage patch doll?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>It has to be the Rubik's cube!</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>And indeed it is. In the 35 years since the puzzle was available to buy outside of Hungary, where its inventor came from, approximately 350m Rubik's cubes have been sold, making it the world's best-selling toy. And they are clever little toys, I must say – there's some maths in them.

I'm Alice…<strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>And I'm Neil. And I feel terrible! </p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>You look terrible, Neil – if you don't mind me saying so! </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>It's because I had to get up really early this morning.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Oh dear! What time did you have to get up?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Eight o'clock.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Oh, Neil! That isn't early! I get up at six every day. It's so peaceful early in the morning.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Hmm. Well, some people are morning people and others… aren't!</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Yes. Well, today we're talking about the biological reason for this – it's all about<strong> circadian rhythms</strong>. They are produced by a so-called body clock in our brains that regulates our body functions: our body temperature, sleepiness and alertness, hunger, and hormone levels. Plants, animals, and many microbes have circadian rhythms. </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>You know a lot about circadian rhythms.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>And I'll ask you a question related to them. What does the word 'circadian' mean? Is it…<br/>a) around a day?<br/>b) every day?<br/>or c) twice a day?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Hmm. I'm going to say a) around a day.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well, we'll find out whether you got the answer right or not later on in the show. Now let's talk about circadian rhythms and our internal clock. </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Why do our bodies need an internal clock to tell us where we are in the day? Isn't it obvious? </p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>No, it isn't – take jet lag, for example. We rely on the predictable cycle of light or dark in a 24-hour period to <strong>synchronise</strong> – or adjust – our body clocks to the environment – and if we mess about with the light and dark cycle by flying into a new time zone, it makes us feel really bad!</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Good point – <strong>jet lag</strong> is the disruption of our circadian rhythms caused by high-speed travel across different time zones, which can cause tiredness and sleep problems. But Alice, if we rely on day turning to night to adjust our body clocks, what happens to blind people? – Because I assume their body clocks can't do this.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Blind people who have some light perception are able to synchronise their circadian rhythms to the light-dark cycle. But those who have no light perception at all… well, let's listen now to Debra Skene, Professor of Neuroendocrinology at the University of Surrey. She can explain what happens.</p><p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Debra Skene, Professor of Neuroendocrinology at the University of Surrey<br/></strong>Totally blind people – they've lost that connection between the light-dark circle and the clock. So there isn't anything wrong with the clock but the clock ticks and oscillates at its own endogenous period just the same as if I were to put you in a dark cave. Your biological internal clock would oscillate at your endogenous circadian period.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So if you're totally blind – or able to see but living in a dark cave – you have a ticking clock but with no connection to the outside world. The clock oscillates at its own <strong>endogenous</strong>, or internal, period.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong><strong>Oscillate</strong> means to move back and forth in a regular rhythm – like the pendulum on a clock.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Do you think my endogenous clock ticks faster than yours, Alice?</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>It isn't a competition, Neil. And actually, mine probably ticks faster than yours since I'm a morning person. Anyway, the normal range in humans is between 23.8 to 24.8 hours. And this is also true for totally blind people.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>But their clocks are free-running – they don't get cues from the outside environment telling them when to wake up, when to eat, when to feel sleepy. So that means they might feel sleepy at the wrong time of day – for example, when they're at work. Or alert in the middle of the night when they should be asleep.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>It's worth talking about people who do <strong>shift work</strong> too – which means work that takes place outside the traditional 9 to 5 day.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Shift workers may suffer similar problems to blind people because they are trying to sleep against the clock. They might sleep in the day and work at night for example – which goes against the light-dark pattern.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>There are some long-term health problems associated with shift work – certain cancers, heart disease, and obesity.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So what can people do to help adapt their circadian rhythms to a night shift schedule?</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well, let's hear what Professor Debra Skene has to say about it.</p><p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Debra Skene, Professor of Neuroendocrinology at the University of Surrey<br/></strong>We do think that exercise and food, caffeine, may be able to modulate in some way, so has some influence on circadian timing, but not as strongly as the light-dark cycle.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So the strongest influence over our circadian rhythm is the light-dark cycle. We can't alter night and day, after all!</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Debra Skene says that other cues such as food and exercise will <strong>modulate</strong> – or adjust – the body clock. So eating three well-balanced meals at regular times each day can help your body clock adapt to an unusual schedule.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Taking <strong>naps</strong> – or short sleeps – just before you start a night shift can help you feel more alert. And keeping to the same sleep schedule every day will also help.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>And don't forget caffeine – my old friend! A cup of coffee works wonders for me in the morning. Now remember I asked: What does 'circadian' mean? Is it… a) around a day, b) every day or c) twice a day?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I said around a day.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>And you were… right! Well done, Neil. The term 'circadian' comes from the Latin <em>circa</em>, meaning 'around' (or 'approximately'), and <em>di</em><em>ē</em><em>m</em>, meaning 'day'.

I'm Neil…</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>And I'm Sophie. What do you know about Cleopatra, Neil?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, she was Queen of Egypt… quite a long time ago.</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Anything else?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Didn't she arrive for a meeting with Roman Emperor Julius Caesar rolled up in a carpet? Or is that a Hollywood invention?</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Some historical sources say she was rolled up in a carpet – and others say she was hidden inside a linen sack.

She made important alliances with Rome to protect her country and was ruthless in dealing with her enemies – in this case, her siblings – who challenged her as sole ruler of Egypt.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong><strong>Wily</strong> means clever and<strong> sibling</strong> is another word for brother or sister. Didn't she have her siblings murdered?</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Yes, she was very <strong>ruthless</strong> – and that means without pity. And today's quiz question is about her family. Can you tell me, Neil, which country was Cleopatra's family originally from? Is it…<br/>a) Macedonia?<br/>b) Ethiopia?<br/>Or c) Egypt?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I'm going for c) Egypt – The obvious answer.</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Well, we'll find out if the obvious answer is the right one, later on in the show. But let's talk some more about Cleopatra's attributes. She may not have been Hollywood gorgeous, but she spoke many languages and was highly educated in philosophy, astronomy, mathematics, and oratory. Here's Susan Walker, Keeper of Antiquities at the Ashmolean Museum at the University of Oxford, with more about this.</p><p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Susan Walker, Keeper of Antiquities at the Ashmolean Museum, University of Oxford<br/></strong>Plutarch says that what was really remarkable about Cleopatra was not so much her beauty as the intelligence of her company. She had a very beautiful voice, which I think is a quality that we perhaps underrate these days, in estimations of celebrity, and she clearly had masses of charisma; the sort of person who would light up a room; so, enormous personal charm.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So the Roman historian Plutarch wrote about Cleopatra's voice, her charisma and personal charm – but not about her beauty.<br/><br/><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>That's right. And<strong> charisma </strong>is, in other words, a strong power to attract people. Cleopatra's voice was also considered very attractive – an attribute we underrate today, according to Susan Walker.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And <strong>underrate</strong> means to place too small a value on something.</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Egyptian Pharaohs were regarded as gods – and <strong>spectacle</strong> – or making a big visual impact – was an important part of this. Cleopatra was very skilled at making grand entrances.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Rolled up in a carpet for Caesar, or dressed up as Venus on board a shimmering golden barge, for Mark Anthony. He was a Roman politician and general.</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>And even her death was spectacular. She and Mark Anthony had lost an important battle against another Roman general, Octavian. Mark Anthony had fatally wounded himself when he heard, mistakenly, that Cleopatra was dead. But before he died, he managed to get back to Cleopatra, who held him in her arms as he died, in her family tomb. Then she decided to take her own life.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>You make it sounds like a Shakespearian tragedy!</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Shakespeare did write a play about it. Now, let's hear from Catherine Edwards, Professor of Classics and Ancient History at Birkbeck, University of London, about this tragic event.</p><p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Catherine Edwards, Professor of Classics and Ancient History at Birkbeck, University of London<br/></strong>She plans her own death in this very sort of calculated manner – a manner that also seems to focus on spectacle yet again. She takes her time, she has a feast, and then, you know, the figs, the basket of figs arrives with the asp in it – or was it perhaps a poisoned hairpin – there's a certain amount of uncertainty about the exact method of her death. I think most sources prefer the snake.</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>So Catherine Edwards says the facts surrounding Cleopatra's suicide aren't clear. She may have used a snake to bite her, smuggled into her room in a basket of fruit – but it may have been a poisoned hairpin – or simply a cup of poison. But she did it in a <strong>calculated</strong> – or carefully planned – way.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>OK, so the final curtain comes down on Cleopatra – but what about the answer to today's quiz question, Sophie?</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>OK. I asked: which country was Cleopatra's family originally from? Is it…a) Macedonia, b) Ethiopia or c) Egypt?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I said… Egypt! Of course it is!</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>And that's the wrong answer, Neil. It's actually a) Macedonia. Cleopatra was a member of the Ptolemaic dynasty, a family of Macedonian Greek origin that ruled Egypt after the death of Alexander the Great.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>You learn something new every day! Talking of which, here are the words we learned in this programme:<br/>the jury's out on something<br/>prominent<br/>attributes<br/>wily<br/>sibling<br/>ruthless<br/>charisma<br/>underrate<br/>spectacle<br/>calculated</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>And that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

Sophie and Neil face their own phobias and discuss the reason why fear of spiders is so common., 01 Dec 2016,"<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript. </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Neil…</p><p><strong>Sophie <br/></strong>And I'm Sophie. Neil, what are you afraid of?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I'm not keen on anything with wings, but I particularly hate moths. They're disgusting, with their fat hairy bodies and… fluttery wings!</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Oh, Neil. Moths are completely harmless. They aren't something to be scared of.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, they are… They get in my face… and my hair. It makes my flesh creep just thinking about them.</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>If something<strong> makes your flesh creep</strong> it makes you feel very frightened. Well, I hope you're going to survive the show today, Neil, because it's all about animal phobias – and a <strong>phobia</strong> is a strong and <strong>irrational</strong> fear. That's a fear not based on reason.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>OK – I'll try. Do you have any animal phobias, Sophie?</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>I can't stand dogs.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Man's best friend? How can you not like dogs – they're cute and loveable. They protect you. They can do tricks!</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Look, for you it's moths – and that's pretty ridiculous, by the way – and for me it's dogs. And that isn't ridiculous. Dogs can be aggressive – they have sharp teeth, they bear their teeth and bark.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>What, like this? [sound of dog growling and barking]</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Yes – and please turn that off, it's upsetting me. It's time for today's quiz question. Can you tell me, Neil, what's the word that describes an irrational fear of insects? Is it…</p><p>a) entomophobia?</p><p>b) thanatophobia?</p><p>Or c) pogonophobia?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I'll say thanatophobia.</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Well, we'll find out if you got the answer right later on in the show. But now let's listen to Dr Dean Burnett, neuroscientist at Cardiff University in the UK, talking about what causes phobic reactions in us.</p><p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Dr Dean Burnett, neuroscientist at Cardiff University, UK<br/></strong>The sensory information is just relayed directly into your brain. One part of it is routed into the cortex, where it's sort of thought about: 'that's that thing, I know that from last time I experienced this', and you can kind of rationalise your way through it. But it also sends a message directly to the amygdala, which immediately triggers the 'fight or flight' response – bang, fire alarm, off it goes, flood the body just in case. It's a survival mechanism.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Dr Dean Burnett there. So, the sensory information for me is a moth fluttering around, getting in my hair.</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>That's right – Or for me, it's a dog getting anywhere near me! Anyway, this information goes into our brains and is processed in two different parts of the brain – the central cortex and the amygdala.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And the information sent to the central cortex triggers a rational response, like, oh it's only a harmless moth – and the stuff that goes to the amygdala triggers an instinctive reaction – the fight or flight response – like, aaarrrggghhh! It's a disgusting moth! Get away from me!</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>The <strong>fight or flight response </strong>is a normal response to stress or danger, and it involves the hormone adrenalin being pumped quickly round the body. The problem is this response can get triggered when there isn't any danger. And this is at the heart of what a phobia is.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So, that's the moth flying in my face while I'm reading in bed, and I feel my heart beating so fast I think I'm going to pass out and I nearly die from anxiety.</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Poor Neil! <strong>Pass out</strong> means to faint or lose consciousness, by the way. Well, we're going to hear from Stephen and Reena now, two self-confessed arachnophobes. They have strong emotional reactions just like you, Neil. Can you identify which animal they fear?</p><p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Stephen and Reena, arachnophobes<br/></strong>'So when I see a spider, I feel like I've been punched in the chest.'<br/>'Complete fear – it's absolutely paralysing. They've never been OK with me. I've always hated them.'<br/>'I've spent a lot of time driving around in the car afraid to go home while my husband worked in London.'<br/>'All rationality goes out the window, and it's… my emotions completely take over.'<br/>'I just…. I just run.'</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>So<strong> arachnophobes</strong> have a strong fear of spiders. And it's the most common animal phobia apparently.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>You could understand that if you were living in Australia – where a bite from a spider might kill you. But the little spiders you get here in the UK don't seem threatening at all.</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Yes, but recent research has shown that we have a <strong>reflexive awareness</strong> of spiders – whether we fear them or not – which means we can spot them automatically without thinking about it. And we don't have the same reflexive awareness of houseflies – or moths – for example.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I expect this awareness is to do with our ancestors. It would've been extremely useful to spot a spider as an early human on the plains of the African Savannah. A bite might kill you – or make you vulnerable to attack from other animals.</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>You're right, Neil! But do you think you were right about today's quiz question? I asked: What's the word that describes an irrational fear of insects? Is it… a) entomophobia, b) thanatophobia or c) pogonophobia?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I said thanatophobia!</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>That's the wrong answer. It's actually a) entomophobia. Entomophobia (also known as insectophobia) is a specific phobia characterized by an excessive or unrealistic fear of one or more classes of insect. Thanatophobia is the fear of death and pogonophobia is the fear of beards or bearded people.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, moths are kind of hairy… Let's remind ourselves of some of the words we heard today:<br/>make your flesh creep<br/>phobia<br/>irrational<br/>fight or flight response<br/>pass out<br/>arachnophobes<br/>reflexive awareness</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>And that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

I'm Alice…</p><p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>And I'm Neil.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>The BBC's 100 Women season is back this week. It will explore women's stories of defiance. And it will include stories of women who inspired us. And that's what we are going to talk about today.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And which woman has inspired you, Alice?</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Oh, well, I have many female <strong>role models</strong> – and this means people looked to by others as examples to be followed. But I must say I have a great admiration for the <strong>suffragettes</strong>.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Ah, the women who fought for the right to vote in the UK!  Yes, I think they were very brave. </p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Yes, so do I. Let's see how much you know about it, Neil. This is today's quiz question for you: Which was the first country to give all women the right to vote in public elections? Was it…<br/>a) Finland?<br/>b) New Zealand?<br/>Or c) The US?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I'm going to say… a) Finland.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well, we'll see if you were right or not later on in the show. // Here in Britain, women's groups <strong>lobbied</strong> – or tried to persuade – parliament for decades before eventually winning the right for all women to vote in 1928.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So why did it take so long?</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Because parliament didn't see votes for women as a priority. Then, 30% of men still didn't have the vote either and politicians felt they needed to address this before thinking about ‘the woman question' as it was known.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>The thing is, without the power to vote it's hard to influence public policy. Politicians are worried about losing popularity with the <strong>electorate</strong> – that's the people who are allowed to vote.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Women had to find a voice – and the Suffragette Movement gave them a voice.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>There were several activists in this movement, but perhaps the most famous was Emmeline Pankhurst.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Emmeline Pankhurst campaigned fearlessly for women's rights for all women – aristocratic ladies, factory workers, conservatives, socialists. Let's listen to Julia Bush, author of <em>Women Against the Vote</em>, talking more about this suffragette leader.</p><p><strong>INSERT<br/> </strong><strong><span>Julia Bush, author of <em>Women Against the Vote<br/></em></span></strong><span>She was a very charismatic leader, one of the great women of the 19th century. And she had a deep compassion for the plight of women. And in particular she was fired by the inequalities that women experienced at that time. It wasn't just about the parliamentary vote, the Suffragette Movement, it was, she in particular wanted wider reforms for women, an improvement in women's status and position.</span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Author Julia Bush.She talks about the plight of women.<strong> Plight </strong>means 'a bad situation'.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Women did have a really hard time back then – especially working class women. And they had little hope of improving their lives because they had no public voice.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So that's what Julia Bush means when she says Mrs Pankhurst wanted wider reforms – access to better schools for women, to university, to better paid jobs and professional careers.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>And it was a big challenge to be heard. June Purvis, Emeritus Professor of Women's and Gender History at the University of Portsmouth here in the UK, talks about how the suffragettes started to <strong>raise their profile </strong>– or get noticed – with deeds not words.</p><p><strong>INSERT<br/> </strong><strong><span>June Purvis,</span></strong><span> </span><strong><span>Emeritus Professor of Women's and Gender History at the University of Portsmouth, UK<br/></span></strong><span>You have women interrupting theatre plays, getting thrown out of church services for interrupting, getting thrown out of Lyons Corner House for standing up on chairs and having little impromptu meetings. But militancy also takes on other forms. It takes on forms of direct action, which start with large demonstrations when women will not be turned back by the police and then it moves on in other forms as well to criminal damage.</span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So women started to interrupt public events to talk about their right to vote.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>An <strong>impromptu</strong> meeting is one that hasn't been planned. Lyons Corner House was a chain of teashops popular at the time. You can imagine that women suddenly standing up on chairs and addressing the public would have been quite shocking in those days!</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Indeed! The suffragettes started small with teashop talks but they began to take more <strong>militant</strong> – or aggressive – direct action.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>And <strong>direct action</strong> means using demonstrations, strikes. The suffragettes chained themselves to railings, broke shop windows.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>It was quite a struggle, and there was no way of delaying the decision to give women the right to vote. In 1914 war broke out in Europe. And with the men away fighting, many women ran their homes, cared for children and relatives, managed money, and often had a job as well.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>So when the war ended in 1918 women had proved how capable they were in so many ways. To deny them the right to vote now seemed ridiculous.<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Although it took another ten years before all women were given the vote on equal terms to men. But come on, Alice, it must be time to hear the answer to today's quiz question!</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>I asked: Which was the first country to give all women the right to vote in public elections? Was it… a) Finland? b) New Zealand? Or c) The US?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I said Finland.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>No, sorry, Neil. It was b) New Zealand. In 1893, New Zealand became the first country to give all adult women the right to vote in national elections.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Now, shall we remind ourselves the words we learned today?</p><p><strong>Alice<br/> </strong>Yes. They were:<br/>role models<br/>suffragettes<br/>lobbied<br/>electorate<br/>plight<br/>raised their profile<br/>impromptu<br/>militant<br/>direct action</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>That's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

Sophie and Neil discuss the ubiquity of sport shoes and why they were invented. ", 17 Nov 2016,"<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Sophie…</p><p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>And I'm Neil.</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>I see you're wearing trainers today, Neil.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Of course, I don't wear anything else.</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Well, trainers – or to use the American term, sneakers – are the subject of today's show. They are <strong>ubiquitous</strong> – that means you can find them everywhere! People wear them across the globe – men, women, kids, teenagers and pensioners. And did you know that 85% of people who buy trainers don't wear them for sport?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>That makes sense to me. I wear mine because they're comfortable.</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>They're also very <strong>tatty</strong> – that means old and in bad condition – if you don't mind me saying so.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Hmm. I should probably get a new pair.</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>There's a lot of choice out there. Hi-tops, gel, air, classic, retro… the list goes on. But before we go any further, I have a question for you. What's a popular US slang term for trainers? Is it…<br/>a) kicks?<br/>b) wedges?<br/>Or c) flats?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I'll go for kicks.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>OK, well we'll find out if you got the answer right later on in the show. Now, it has become socially acceptable to wear athletic <strong>apparel</strong> or clothing – including trainers – in situations where ten years ago it would not. </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, I think my apparel of jeans and tatty trainers is socially acceptable – at our workplace, anyway.</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Mark Zuckerberg, founder of Facebook, is famous for his <strong>dressed-down</strong> – or informal – look of hoodies and trainers. You can pay anything from a few pounds for unbranded trainers to thousands of pounds for limited edition brands like Nike or Addidas – and <strong>limited edition</strong> means something produced in very small numbers.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Why would anybody spend a thousand pounds on trainers? And how many people would actually recognize that you were wearing Nike limited edition ones rather than regular ones?<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Other sneakerheads, Neil – a <strong>sneakerhead</strong> is somebody who collects limited edition sneakers. It's an American term. But trainers are not new - in the nineteenth century, people wore sneakers as a mark of their <strong>prosperity</strong> – or economic success. Let's listen to Elizabeth Semmelhack, curator of the Bata Shoe Museum in Toronto in Canada.</p><p><strong>INSERT<br/> </strong><strong><span>Elizabeth Semmelhack, curator of the Bata Shoe Museum in Toronto, Canada<br/></span></strong><span>This new industrial age actually ushered in a new class, the emerging middle class, that was able to, now, have leisure time, because of their new economic success. And so what they did was, they wanted to, sort of, express the fact that they had leisure time by playing. But they also wanted to signify that they were doing these things by their sartorial choices. And so the sneaker, in part, was invented to meet the needs of this new class, so that they could very conspicuously show that they were playing.</span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>What does it mean to <strong>usher</strong> <strong>in</strong>, Sophie?</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>It means to mark the beginning of something. In this case, the industrial revolution marked the beginning of a new social class – the middle class – who made a lot of money from industry.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And why were they interested in trainers?</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>They wanted a way of showing people that they were so rich they didn't need to work all the time. And by wearing trainers they were saying, 'I'm busy playing tennis'. <strong>Sartorial</strong>, by the way, means 'related to clothes'.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>These days wearing trainers doesn't reveal much about social class. For example, Mark Zuckerberg and I look surprisingly similar in our hoodies and trainers. You'd have to guess which one of us was a multibillionaire – and which one was… not!</p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>People respond to current trends in popular sport through the trainers they wear. And here's Matt Powell for the US consumer research group, NPD, to tell us more.</span></p><p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong><span>Matt Powell, US consumer research group, NPD<br/></span></strong><span>When I first got into the retail business in the 70s the sexy sport, if you will, was tennis. </span><span>And we all wore tennis apparel for casual wear, and we played tennis, and we wore tennis shoes. And we identified with athletes like McEnroe, and Borg, and Connors. Over time though, it has become even a broader range, there was a jogging craze in the 70s – everybody was out jogging, and then that became a full-fledged running business. The basketball business really exploded in the mid late 80s with the emergence of Michael Jordan. </span></p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>So Matt Powell knows a thing or two about current consumer trends - he says in the 1970s there was a <strong>craze</strong> – or enthusiasm – for tennis and jogging. And this led to big sales of the apparel associated with these sports.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Are tennis shoes still sexy, Sophie?</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Maybe – but basketball hi-tops are sexier. Michael Jordan started that trend back in the 1980s and it's still going strong. Well, we're running out of time. Let's go back to our quiz question. I asked you: What is a slang term for trainers? Is it… a) kicks, b) wedges or c) flats?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>It has to be kicks. I'm right, aren't I?</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>I have to tell you, Neil, you're… right!</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes!</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Wedges are shoes or boots with a triangular wedge-shaped heel and flats are a woman's shoe with no heel.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I<strong> know my onions, </strong>you see, Sophie.</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Yes, in other words, you know a lot about something you do.

I'm Sophie…</p><p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>And I'm Neil. Did you watch the Tour de France cycle race this summer, Sophie?</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>No, I didn't. I'm not a cycling enthusiast, Neil – unlike you!</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>It was pretty exciting stuff – in fact just thinking about it, makes me want to jump on my bike and ride off right now!</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Don't go just yet, because today's show is all about bicycles and I've got a question for you. Who invented the first <strong>pneumatic</strong> – or air-filled – cycle tyre in 1888?  Was it …<br/>a) John Boyd Dunlop?<br/>b) Charles Goodyear?<br/>Or c) Harvey Samuel Firestone?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, I'm going to go for a) John Boyd Dunlop. Can I go now?</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>No, you can't. We'll find out later on in the show if you got the tyre question right or not. But first, I'd like you to tell us a bit about the history of the bike.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>If you insist. Well, before the modern bike was invented in 1885, people rode boneshakers, high wheelers, and even tricycles.</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>A tricycle is a three-wheeler bike that young children ride before they learn to balance on a two-wheeler. But what's a ‘boneshaker', Neil?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>It was the first bike with pedals, called a ‘velocipede' by its manufacturers. Others called it a 'boneshaker' because its tyres were made of iron so it was very uncomfortable to ride – especially over cobblestone streets.</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>It sounds awful! Now, moving on, the bicycle started out as an expensive toy for the middle classes – but when manufacturing costs dropped, they became a vehicle for social change.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>By the late nineteenth century, bikes had become affordable for a large proportion of the population – and the technology had moved on so they weren't so dangerous – or so uncomfortable to ride.</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>And for the first time in history, people had the freedom to travel where they wanted when they wanted – including women! Let's hear more about women and cycling from Robert Penn, UK author, and lifelong cyclist.</p><p><strong>INSERT<br/> </strong><strong>Robert Penn, author, and lifelong cyclist<br/></strong>In very practical terms, it had a very significant effect on what women wore in public. And when they first rode bicycles they were expected to ride in long ankle length skirts and voluminous petticoats and of course that was entirely impractical so they adopted what was called rational dress. And rational dress was a better fitting jacket and pantaloon trousers which were cinched below the knee, which meant that nothing got caught in the chain. And at first there was massive public outrage. There were court cases about whether or not women were allowed to be served in pubs wearing this sort of dress.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So women in the nineteenth century typically wore long skirts and <strong>voluminous</strong> – or large – petticoats. A <strong>petticoat</strong> is a piece of clothing worn under a dress or skirt. But what does ‘rational dress' mean exactly, Sophie?</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong><strong>Rational</strong> here means logical. It wasn't logical to wear ankle length skirts with voluminous petticoats on a bike, so women started wearing pantaloon trousers.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong><strong>Pantaloon</strong> trousers were baggy – though they were <strong>cinched</strong> – or gathered in – below the knee so they wouldn't catch in the bicycle chain.</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>But pantaloons for women still caused <strong>outrage</strong> – or shock and anger – because although they were baggy, they were still trousers and they didn't go down to the ankle. So bikes played a part in women's struggle for <strong>emancipation</strong> – or freedom. But let's listen now to Robert Penn, who claims that it also played a role in our evolutionary history.</p><p><strong>INSERT<br/> </strong><strong>Robert Penn, author, and lifelong cyclist<br/></strong>It definitely shored up the gene pool in countries like Britain because it meant that people could go further than they ever had before in order to find a partner for life and to mate. And so what started as a really faddish leisure pursuit, within a decade of 1885, the bicycle became the most popular form of transport on the planet, and it has been ever since.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>What does <strong>shore up </strong>mean, Sophie?</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>It means support. And <strong>gene pool</strong> here refers to the collection of genes in a particular population. So, when people travelled further to marry and have children, they were making the gene pool bigger and healthier.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And Robert Penn uses the word ‘faddish' he says cycling started as a faddish thing. A <strong>fad</strong> – or <strong>faddish</strong> activity – means an enthusiasm for something that doesn't last very long.</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>But your enthusiasm for cycling is not a fad.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>No, it isn't.  Do you think lycra wearing is a fad and we'll all go back to wearing pantaloons in the future, Sophie? No? Not a good look? OK, maybe it's time for the answer to today's quiz question.</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>I asked: Who invented the first cycle tyre in 1888?  Was it … a) John Boyd Dunlop, b) Charles Goodyear or c) Harvey Samuel Firestone?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I said John Boyd Dunlop. Tell me I'm right!</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>You are… right! Well done, Neil. Scottish inventor and veterinary surgeon John Boyd Dunlop developed the pneumatic rubber tyre. Although it was invented as an improvement on the bicycle, the pneumatic tyre arrived on the scene just in time to contribute to the success of the car.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Now, here are the words we heard today. They are:<br/>pneumatic<br/>voluminous<br/>petticoat<br/>rational<br/>pantaloon<br/>cinched<br/>outrage<br/>emancipation<br/>shore up<br/>gene pool<br/>fad or faddish</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

I'm Sophie…</p><p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>And I'm Neil. Oh, hang on… I've just got a new tweet here. Listen to this: ‘Hi Neil, about what you said the other day I…' Oh, this is from a friend who doesn't realize that regular tweets are in the public domain – and that anyone in the world could read them if they wanted to. I need to give her some lessons in cool – she just doesn't get it!</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Well, Mr Cool, I don't <strong>get</strong> Twitter either – which means I don't understand why people like it. Why do you want to put tweets out there for everyone to read?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>You'd love it if you tried it, Sophie.</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>I'm not so sure, Neil. Anyway, the subject of today's show is online identity. There are lots of social media platforms out there – Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, Instagram – and they're all different, and the question is, do we use different identities when we are using different digital spaces? And what's all this tweeting, posting, and hashtagging doing to our language and our psyche?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And <strong>psyche</strong> means mind. Well, it's messed with my mind. I'm a total addict. I check my accounts as soon as I get up in the morning – and sometimes in the night if I wake up. I couldn't get through the day without it.</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Well, I'm the opposite – I'm totally unaddicted – and therefore don't need to worry about my psyche. Now, before we explore this further, let's have today's quiz question.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>OK, here's one for you, Sophie. Can you tell me how many social media accounts the average person has? Is it…<br/>a) 3?<br/>b) 5?<br/>Or c) 8?</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>I'll say 3 – though that sounds like 3 too many to me.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>OK, we'll find out if you got the answer right later on in the show. I've got … 3… 5 no hang on. I've got 6…</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>While you add up all your accounts, Neil, let's listen to Dr Aleks Krotoski, broadcaster, journalist and social psychologist. She's talking about the language we use to present ourselves online.</p><p><strong>INSERT<br/> </strong><strong>Dr Aleks Krotoski, broadcaster, journalist and social psychologist<br/></strong>Online we have this extraordinary opportunity to explore different aspects of ourselves through primarily text-based communication, by manipulating language and becoming wordsmiths ourselves. So for example, your Twitter handle will have a ‘you' that is probably different from a ‘you' that you share if, say, for example you have a Facebook account, or is different from a ‘you' that you would share if you're on a particular forum of something that you like – some music that you like, or food that you like, or whatever it is.</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>So we are wordsmiths with handles. What does that mean?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>A <strong>wordsmith</strong> is someone who is skilled at using words. And a <strong>handle</strong> means a name.</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>What's your Twitter handle, then?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, you'll need to get a Twitter account to find out. But I have other handles for other social media.</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>So there are lots of ‘yous' out there, Neil?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes. For example, I think I'm cooler on Twitter than on Facebook. I talk more, you know, street. ‘Check out my new creps – they're bangin'.'</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Yo – they're well sick.<strong> Street</strong>, by the way, refers to the language that goes with street – or urban – culture, where things like skate boarding and hip-hop are popular. And I think ‘creps' are trainers – am I right, bruv?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, Sophie. I didn't know you could talk street!</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>I have identities that you know nothing about, Neil! But getting back to Twitter and how big an audience there is, doesn't that huge audience worry you, Neil? Aren't you scared of making a huge blooper online and becoming a laughing stock?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>OK, <strong>blooper</strong> means an embarrassing mistake – and being <strong>a laughing stock</strong> means looking very silly when you were trying to be serious. Well, Sophie, I'm quite careful about how I manage my online identity. I take time to craft my words – just like I craft them for this show!</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Really? So no bloopers, on this show, then? I seem to remember one or two… Well, let's move on now and listen now to Dr Aleks Krotoski again,talking about what motivates us to put our thoughts and ideas out there online.</p><p><strong>INSERT<br/> </strong><strong>Dr Aleks Krotoski, broadcaster, journalist and social psychologist<br/></strong>It's allowing us a platform for a potential audience that is massive, absolutely huge, so yeah, there is a lot of ‘look at me, look at me' online, but that's, I think, because we're trying to reach out to as much of the audience – we're trying to get as much attention as we possibly can, in order to get that tribe. And, also, in order to basically reach out and tell people, 'Hey we're around'. It's like having a telephone on all the time: ‘Hey, chat to me. I'm here. Anybody wanna hang out?' It's a big social playground.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Aleks Krotoski says we're all show offs who want attention. Am I a show off, Sophie?</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Yes, you are, Neil. Though Aleks says it isn't just about showing off – it's also about connecting with people in our <strong>tribe</strong> – or social group. But that tribe can be enormous because people are reading posts globally – not just in your own town or even your own country.<span><br/></span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Hastag scarythought! Now, I think it's time for the answer to today's quiz question. I asked: How many social media accounts does the average person have? Is it… a) 3, b) 5 or c) 8?</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>I said b) 3.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And that is … not the right answer, Sophie. The average person has 5 social media accounts and spends around 1 hour and 40 minutes browsing these networks every day, accounting for 28% of the total time spent on the internet. Now, here are the words we heard today:<br/>get something<br/>psyche<br/>wordsmith<br/>handle<br/>street<br/>blooper<br/>laughing stock<br/>tribe</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>And that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

I'm Sophie…</p><p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>And I'm Neil.</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>What are you reading?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>A news blog – it says here that the fossil of a two-headed dinosaur has been discovered in Greece. Look! Look at this picture!</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Honestly, Neil, you shouldn't believe everything you read on the internet! This story is from one of those fake news websites that float about on social media. And you aren't the only one to get taken in – even serious news channels report these types of stories as if they were true.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong><strong>Taken in</strong> means fooled by something. Well, I must admit, I did believe it. And I didn't know that <strong>fake</strong> – or pretend – news sites existed. How am I supposed to know what's fake and what's real? So many extraordinary things happen!</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>That's a good question, and actually, digital news and its effect on traditional newspapers is the subject of today's show. The thing is, if you read a traditional print newspaper like I do, you'd find stories that are more <strong>reliable</strong> – ones you can trust.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, enjoy your traditional print newspaper while you can, Sophie, because they're going to disappear pretty soon – the same way as the dinosaurs!</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Hmm. It is true that print newspapers are <strong>feeling the pinch</strong> these days – and that means not making enough money. But I will miss them if they go. Which brings me on to today's quiz question. Neil, how many national print newspapers are currently sold in the UK a day? Is it…<br/>a) 70,000?<br/>b) 700,000?<br/>Or c) 7 million?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, I'll go for a) 70,000. It can't be much more than that, surely.</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Well, we'll find out whether you got the answer right or not later in the show. But moving on now, we've discussed one disadvantage of digital news – that it can be hard to distinguish a real story from a fake one – given the mass of information available on the web. So maybe you should tell us about the advantages, Neil. </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, you can access news 24/7 – and search for it on your phone or tablet without having to flip through pages of stuff you aren't interested in. It isn't all in black and white, it isn't all about reading – you can watch and listen too. And make comments of your own.</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>OK. Well, let's listen to Tim Luckhurst, Professor of Journalism at Kent University, to see what he thinks is important in journalism nowadays.</p><p><strong><span>INSERT<br/></span></strong><strong><span>Tim Luckhurst, Professor of Journalism at Kent University<br/></span></strong><span>It doesn't matter whether your local journalist produces news on a tablet, on a mobile phone, in print, online, on television, or on radio. What matters is that there should be a diversity of journalism available and that it should be provided by professional reporters whose job is to do an honest objective job, impartially, in the public interest, not simply to rant or express opinions.</span></p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Tim Luckhurst there. He says that news will be successful on any platform – digital or traditional – so long as reporters are honest and objective in their pursuit of a good story. If you're <strong>objective</strong> it means you aren't influenced by personal feelings or opinions. If you <strong>rant</strong> you speak in an angry opinionated way about something.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Now, newspapers need to make money in order to pay their journalists. And with circulation falling dramatically, they need to find other ways to make newspapers pay.</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>A newspaper's <strong>circulation</strong> is the number of copies it distributes per day. Well, selling more advertising space is one way, isn't it?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, but many advertisers are choosing to use digital platforms because they reach a wider and more targeted audience. And this is one reason why digital news is taking over – it can pay for itself through advertising.</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>I wouldn't mind paying more for a newspaper if I knew the quality of journalism is good.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>But increasingly people are expecting good quality journalism for free.</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Newspapers have been around since the invention of the printing press, and as <strong>chronicles</strong> – or written accounts – of people's lives, are an important historical resource. Let's listen to <span>Alex Cox, researcher at genealogy website, findmypast.co.uk</span> talking more about this.</p><p><strong>INSERT<br/> </strong><strong><span>Alex Cox, researcher at genealogy website, findmypast.co.uk <br/></span></strong>During the First World War local papers always printed In Memoriam columns where they'd list local dead. What a lot of them also did was they allowed relatives to submit short poems about their deceased loved ones and some of them were five or six lines – not very long – but they're really, really quite powerful. And the paper dedicated page space to print not just one of these, but multiple, and I don't know whether a modern paper would even consider doing that today.</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong><strong>Deceased</strong> is another word for dead – in this case, it refers to the British soldiers who died in the First World War.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Local papers, at the time, printed poems written by the families of the dead men. Those poems, captured in print, are an important historical record of the time.</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Indeed. Now, remember, Neil, I asked you: How many national print newspapers are currently sold in the UK a day? Is it… a) 70,000, b) 700,000 or c) 7 million?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, I remember. And I said 70,000.</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Well, I'm sorry Neil, but you are wrong. The answer is actually c) 7 million. But the numbers are falling.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, that's still a few million more than I thought.

I'm Sophie… </p><p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>And I'm Neil. So, Sophie, the subject of today's show is attraction – do you believe in love at first sight? </p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>No, I don't. I think it takes time to get to know somebody well enough to know if you love them. But I have a friend who says when she saw her husband for the first time… </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>That was before they got married? </p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>That's right – when they met for the first time, that was it: a bolt out of the blue. And they got married three months later. </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>A<strong> bolt out of the blue </strong>means something totally unexpected. Well, that sounds very romantic. And leads me on to today's quiz question. Sophie, what percentage of Americans said they believe in love at first sight? Is it...<br/>a) 26%?<br/>b) 56%?<br/>Or c) 86%? </p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>I'm not an old romantic like you Neil, so I'm going to go for a) 26%. </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, we'll find out later on in the show if you're right to be sceptical or not, Sophie. And <strong>sceptical</strong> for those of you who don't know, means to have doubts about something. </p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>I think you can be physically attracted to somebody straight away. I just don't think you can fall in love with somebody so easily. Love is about other things: compatibility, personality and a good sense of humour. </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, humour is important, but apparently, Sophie, for men it's all about the waist-hip ratio. According to research, the ideal waist-hip ratio for women is 0.7 – where <strong>ratio</strong> means the relationship between two sizes – and you get this figure by dividing the waist measurement by the hip measurement. </p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>I see. And why do men find 0.7 so irresistible? </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, let's listen to Dr Anna Machin, an Evolutionary Anthropologist from the University of Oxford, explaining what a man is looking for. </p><p><strong>INSERT<br/> </strong><strong>Dr Anna Machin, Evolutionary Anthropologist, University of Oxford<br/></strong>He's going to look for signs for fertility and what we call fecundity and good health. And the major indicator of that in women is the waist-hip ratio. And the waist-hip ratio – the absolute ideal – what men find most attractive regardless of culture – this has been tested in many different cultures round the world – is 0.7 and that's really your classic hourglass figure. And the reason why that universally is attractive is because it's tied to the health of that individual. There's a very strong relationship between someone circulating oestrogen and testosterone – obviously you want the oestrogen to be high and the testosterone to be low for a woman to be fertile, and also her general health, so .7 is linked to lower risk of heart disease, lower risk of diabetes and certain sorts of cancers. </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So a waist-hip ratio of 0.7 <strong>correlates</strong> – or has a strong relationship – with good general health and fertility in women. </p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>And men find this attractive because it identifies <strong>fertile</strong> women – women who will be able to <strong>conceive</strong> – or get pregnant – and have babies successfully. </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Dr Machin also mentions that 0.7 is the classic <strong>hourglass figure</strong> – which means curvy! </p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Do you like curves, Neil? </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Mind your own business, Sophie. But all this waist-hip theory of attraction isn't very romantic, is it? </p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>You're right, it isn't. And whilst we do judge people by the way they look – we also use our sense of smell to sniff out our ideal <strong>mate</strong> – or sexual partner. Apparently, we can detect whether people are genetically different to us by the way they smell. And parents who have different immune systems create healthier babies.  </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So it's back to having babies again – all biology and chemistry – and not about feelings at all.</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Well, let's leave chemistry behind for a moment and listen to Professor David Perrett, at the School of Psychology and Neuroscience at St Andrews University in Scotland. He talks about other factors that play a role in attraction.</p><p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>David Perrett, Professor at the School of Psychology and Neuroscience at St Andrews University in Scotland <br/> </strong>Plastic surgery really doesn't count for much in the end. You could be with somebody who's aesthetically very beautiful but if they don't smile or react then that counts for much less. So we can change our faces by interacting with others and doing so in a pleasant manner, and that will aid our attractiveness and make others interested in us. </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>What does <strong>aesthetically </strong>mean, Sophie? </p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>It means judging something by the way it looks. And whilst we all enjoy a pretty face, most of us are looking for more than that. We are looking for people who appear friendly and approachable, and who we share interests with. </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Exactly – and personally, I think kind eyes are very important – with a bit of a twinkle. What about you, Sophie? </p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>I like a good sense of humour. </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Very good. Now, remember I asked you, Sophie: What percentage of Americans said they believe in love at first sight? Is it… a) 26%, b) 56% or c) 86%? </p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>I said 26%. </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Sorry, that's the wrong answer, Sophie. 56% of Americans believe in love at first sight, and the percentage is even higher for married people and those in relationships, according to a poll conducted by the website CBS.com in 2013.</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Well, Americans are a romantic bunch.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Me too, and I'm British.

Sophie and Neil discuss how feeling lonely can help us to survive., 13 Oct 2016,"<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Sophie…</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I'm Neil.</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>How was your weekend, Neil?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, not great – I hadn't got anything planned, so I didn't see anyone for two days. And to be honest, I felt very lonely! There was a real physical feeling in the pit of my stomach.</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Poor Neil! You do sound really <strong>down in the dumps</strong>, and that means unhappy! Well, the subject of today's show is loneliness. And <strong>loneliness</strong> is sometimes described as a social pain – a pain that tells us that we're <strong>isolated</strong> – or lacking contact with others – which motivates us to seek out companionship.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I'd no idea that feeling lonely had a biological explanation! How does being sociable help us, as a species, then, Sophie?</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>It's all about <strong>cooperation</strong> – or working together to get something done – for example, finding food.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, I suppose I cooperated with the pizza delivery guy for a shared outcome.</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>You paid him and he gave you the pizza?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Exactly. But it wasn't a socially enriching experience. That's the bad thing about London – you can feel lonely, even surrounded with people. It isn't easy to meet people you really like – so often you might as well just on your own.</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Good point. And I have a question about cities and living alone, Neil, because it's on the rise. Which country has the highest proportion of people living on their own? Is it …<br/>a) the US?<br/>b) Japan?<br/>Or c) Sweden?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, I'm going to guess b) Japan.</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>OK, we'll see if you got that right later on in the show. So, getting back to loneliness – the idea is that because it makes us feel bad, it motivates us to go out and meet people. Some people are more likely to feel lonely than others because our genes play a role in this tendency.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I wonder if I inherited loneliness genes.</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>I don't know, Neil, but while in some situations being lonely may be a good thing, because it encourages you to be sociable, in other situations it may be useful to <strong>tolerate</strong> – or put up with – loneliness. Let's listen to Professor Dorret Boomsma at the Vrije University in Amsterdam talking about this.</p><p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Professor Dorret Boomsma, Department of Biological Psychology at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam<br/></strong>So the intriguing question is why do genes that influence loneliness still exist? And one explanation is that probably they do not only have negative effects. In some situations it is an advantage to be able to tolerate high levels of loneliness and that is why the genes are maintained in the population.</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>So, inheriting genes for loneliness might not be a bad thing. Why's that, Neil?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Because it means you can tolerate being alone for a long time without feeling bad.</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Well, that's an <strong>intriguing</strong> – or very interesting – idea. But it shows that you probably don't have those genes, Neil, because you did feel bad at the weekend.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>That's true. And actually, that was despite spending a long time on Facebook, and that's a form of social contact. But does all the tweeting, messaging, and chatting online that we do make us lonelier, because we're getting out less and meeting fewer people? Or do virtual connections stop us from feeling lonely?</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Those are also intriguing questions. Let's listen to Professor Eric Klinenberg sociologist at New York University and author of a book about living alone. He talks about this.</p><p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Eric Klinenberg, sociologist at New York University and author<br/></strong>We just don't have great research showing that we are significantly more lonely or isolated today than we were ten or twenty or thirty years ago, which means critics who say that Facebook or the internet or whatever device you carry with you, is making you lonelier and more miserable - they just don't have that much evidence to back it up.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So there isn't enough evidence to <strong>back up</strong> – or support – the claim that social media is making us feel lonelier.</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>No, there isn't. OK, now before I give you the answer to today's quiz question, Neil, did you know that loneliness is <strong>contagious</strong>?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>You mean you can catch it from somebody like a cold?</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Yes. There are environmental factors involved in loneliness too. For example, if somebody you talk to every day is always unfriendly towards you, this makes you statistically more likely to be negative in your interactions with somebody else.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, let's try and stay friendly towards each other, then, Sophie. You can start by telling me whether I got today's quiz question right!</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>OK. I asked: which country has the highest proportion of people living on their own? Is it … a) the US, b) Japan or c) Sweden?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I said Japan.</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>This is the wrong answer, I'm afraid. It's actually c) Sweden. Nearly half of all Swedish households are <strong>single-occupancy</strong> – or for one person. Living alone in Sweden is arguably the norm because it's so easy – there are many affordable single-occupancy apartments and young Swedes can expect to move into their own apartment once they graduate high-school.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>OK, now let's hear the words we learned today again, Sophie.</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Yes, OK. They are:<br/>down in the dumps<br/>loneliness<br/>isolated<br/>cooperation<br/>tolerate<br/>intriguing<br/>back up<br/>contagious<br/>single occupancy</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, that's the end of this edition of 6 Minute English.

Alice and Neil discuss identity and how appearances can be deceptive., 06 Oct 2016,"<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Alice…</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I'm Neil. So, Alice, what do you see when you look at me?</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well, male, Caucasian, early 40s, short auburn hair, bushy eyebrows, thin lips... </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>OK. So that's how you see me? It sounds like a police report, and I'm not sure I like your observation about thin lips. <strong>Caucasian</strong> means white skinned and European, by the way.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>And today the show is about <strong>identity</strong> – who or what a person is. And the way people see us forms part of our sense of identity, while another part comes from our <strong>ethnic</strong> – or racial – identity. So my question for you today, Neil, is:  What percentage of the UK population describe themselves as ethnically mixed? Is it …<br/>a) 0.9%?<br/>b) 5.9%?<br/>Or c) 9%?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>OK… I think that it's a) 0.9%.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well, we'll find out if you got the answer right or wrong later on in the show. Now, Neil, you are, of course, many more things than my physical description of you!</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I'm glad to hear that. And it's true, that until you actually hear somebody speak, there are lots of things you can't know about them. For example, which country they're from, what language they speak…</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Yes. So looking at me, what would you say, Neil? </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I would say Alice that you're a typical English rose.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Thanks, Neil – and <strong>English rose</strong> describes an attractive girl with a pale delicate <strong>complexion</strong> – or skin colour – but you can't actually tell where a person is from by the way they look.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, I suppose you're right. I have a friend who also looks very English like you, but she's a real ethnic mix. Her dad is German and her mum is Brazilian!</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well, let's hear from New York City actress and playwright, Sarah Jones, talking about her complicated ethnicity.</p><p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Sarah Jones, actress and playwright, New York City<br/></strong>My family on my dad's side, my grandparents, are from the South. There's some Caribbean in there, black Americans from the South and the Caribbean, and then on my mother's side there are people from the Caribbean, from Ireland but you know Irish American, German American. People would ask me if I was adopted when they saw my mother's white skin - she's actually mixed but she's white from a distance, and I'm black from a distance.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Sarah Jones there. Well, Sarah has family from all over the world! I suppose the United States - and New York City, especially - is a real melting pot.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>That's right. And <strong>melting pot</strong> describes a society made from people of different countries who live together and create a new shared culture.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And people think Sarah is <strong>adopted</strong> – or raised by parents who aren't biologically hers – because she looks so different to her mum.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>But I expect Sarah sees herself as American. New York is where she was born and raised.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>That's right. But her grandparents weren't. Do you think you change when you go and live in another country with people different to you?</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Yes, I do. My neighbours are Turkish but they've lived in England for 45 years so they’ve integrated into our culture. They enjoy English things like… our TV soap operas, cooking turkey at Christmas, and drinking tea with milk.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And to <strong>integrate</strong> means to join a group of people, and often involves changing your habits and customs.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Yes. OK. So, Neil, to what extent does the way other people see us, actually change us? Let's listen to Julian Baggini, a writer and philosopher here in the UK and find out what he thinks.</p><p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Julian Baggini, writer and philosopher, UK<br/></strong>It seems very evident that our sense of self isn't something that comes entirely from within. And of course we're affected by the way other people see us. And that's one of the most formative things in creating our sense of identity. I mean, I think it's kind of a two-way process that's ongoing. Our sense of who we are is always a response in part to how other people see us.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So Julian Baggini believes the way other people see us is <strong>formative</strong> in creating our sense of identity – or who we are. And formative means important for the development of something.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>So if enough people see you as an English rose, you might start to see yourself as an English rose, even if you aren't ethnically English.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I'm not so sure. The friend I talked about earlier, she comes across as much more Brazilian than English in the way she behaves. She doesn't have the famous English reserve – but you'd never know it by looking at her.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>And <strong>reserve</strong> means hiding what you're thinking or feeling. I think I'm guilty of English reserve. How about you, Neil?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>No, I think I <strong>wear my heart on my sleeve</strong>, Alice – which means I make my feelings clear. OK, I think it's time for the answer to today's quiz question.<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Okey-dokey, fair enough. I asked you: What percentage of the UK population described themselves as ethnically mixed? Is it … a) 0.9%, b) 5.9% or c) 9%?<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I said a) 0.9%.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Yes. And you were on the money today, Neil! Well done! According to a survey conducted by the BBC in 2011, when asked about their own ethnic origins, 0.9% of the UK population said they were mixed race, although it's thought that the real figure is 2% or more. Now, could you remind us of the words we heard today, Neil?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Sure. They are:<br/>Caucasian<br/>identity<br/>ethnic<br/>English rose<br/>complexion<br/>melting pot<br/>adopted<br/>integrate<br/>formative<br/>reserve<br/>wear your heart on your sleeve </p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>And that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

Neil and Alice discuss rhetoric, commas, and why using full stops when we’re texting can make us sound insincere.", 29 Sep 2016,"<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Alice…<strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>And I'm Neil. </p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>So, Neil, you texted me earlier and didn't put a full stop at the end.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>You're right, I never use full stops in texts – they're much too <strong>stuffy</strong> – or formal. Texting is like conversation and you don't need lots of punctuation.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well, punctuation is the subject of today's show. And I know I'm a bit of a stickler about this, but I think you're letting the standards of written English language slip. <strong> </strong> </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>A <strong>stickler</strong> is someone who insists on a certain way of doing a particular thing.Surely you aren't such a stickler for punctuation rules that you want to stop the evolution of English, Alice? </p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>No, of course not, but I am a stickler when people don't follow the rules of punctuation because this makes written text ambiguous or difficult to understand.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong><strong>Ambiguous</strong> means when something has two or more meanings. Can you give me some examples of punctuation making text easier to understand?</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Alright then, here you are: Let's eat Grandma.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Ugh! It brings to mind the children's story Little Red Riding Hood, about a girl, her grandmother and a hungry wolf. Is that the wolf talking to another wolf friend of his?</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>No, it's the girl, Red Riding Hood, talking to her grandmother. And with a well-placed comma it becomes: Let's eat, Grandma. Without proper punctuation the sentence is ambiguous. Now, before we look at more reasons why punctuation is important, let's have today's quiz question.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>OK. What is another word for the keyboard sign that represents a paragraph? Is it…<br/>a) pilcrow?<br/>b) bodkin?<br/>or c) pica?</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>I'll say c) pica.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, we'll find out later in the show if you got that right or not. </p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Moving on now, punctuation was invented by the Ancient Greeks. They used a series of dots to indicate different lengths of pauses. A short unit of text was a comma, a longer unit was a colon, and a complete sentence was a periodos. We used these terms to name our punctuation marks – although they actually refer to the clauses not to the dots themselves.<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So early punctuation wasn't about grammar, then?</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>No, it was about public speaking. The different dots indicated different lengths of pauses: short, medium, and long. These pauses broke the text up so it was easier to read and therefore easier to understand.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>OK, let's hear from the punctuation expert, Keith Houston, who is author of <em>Shady Characters: Ampersands, Interrobangs and Other Typographical Curiosities. </em>Here he's talking on BBC Radio 4's programme Word of Mouth<em>.</em></p><p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Keith Houston, author of <em>Shady Characters: Ampersands, Interrobangs and Other Typographical Curiosities<br/></em></strong>Punctuation started off being all about rhetoric – about speech – but we started to assign rules, I think around about the 8th century or so. We started to associate the marks, not just with pauses, but with the actual grammatical units that were used to punctuate. So, a comma wasn't just a dot that meant, pause for this length of time. It now actually marked out a clause, you know, it marked out a sort of consistent logical bit of writing.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>So <strong>rhetoric</strong> – or the art of persuasive speaking – was very important to the Greeks and to the Romans. And to be persuasive, you need to be understood. And these little punctuation marks helped the speaker to deliver their text more effectively.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Later on, these marks were given grammatical functions. The comma marks out a <strong>clause</strong> – or grammatical unit containing a subject and a verb – as well as telling the reader to pause briefly.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Are you beginning to see why being <strong>sloppy</strong> – or careless – with punctuation isn't a good thing, Neil?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, I am. Though recent research into texting and punctuation suggests that people consider messages ending in full stops to be less sincere than ones without.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Really? Well, now might be a good time to hear about how it can be hard to make writing unambiguous. We can misinterpret the written word, even with punctuation to guide us. Here's Keith Houston again, talking to Michael Rosen, presenter of Word of Mouth.</p><p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Michael Rosen and Keith Houston<br/></strong>MR: Quite often I notice on Twitter and places like that people misunderstand irony. I mean because we only have text in front of us not intonation. So do we need an irony punctuation –'hello, I'm being ironic now' – do we need that?<br/>KH: You might say that emoticons are the best way to go about that – a little winking emoticon – you know, semicolon, dash, closing parenthesis.<br/>MR: Oh yes, yes, of course - they've invented all these with the punctuation that we have on the keyboard.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong><strong>Irony</strong> means using words to mean something that is the opposite of its <strong>literal</strong> – or most usual – meaning. But when we're online – using email or Twitter – you don't hear the words, and that's why it can be hard to know what feelings the writer intended.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>That's right. When we use <strong>emoticons</strong> – facial expressions made out of keyboard characters – we can signpost the feelings we intend.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Now, Alice, remember I asked you: What is another word for the keyboard sign that represents a paragraph? Is it a) pilcrow, b) bodkin or c) pica?</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Yes, I said pica.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And you were wrong, I'm afraid. The right answer is pilcrow, which comes from the Greek word 'paragraphos'. The earliest reference of the modern 'pilcrow' is from 1440 with the Middle English word 'pylcrafte'.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Oh dear, sad face. I hate it when I get the quiz question wrong. Now, can we hear the words we learned today?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, they are:<br/>stuffy<br/>stickler<br/>rhetoric<br/>clause<br/>sloppy<br/>irony<br/>literal<br/>emoticons</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

I'm Alice…</p><p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>And I'm Neil. [rattles a bottle of pills]</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>What have you got there, Neil?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Antibiotics. I had a blister on my big toe, and it got infected. My whole toe swelled up like a balloon! The swelling has gone down now with these little wonder drugs. Look, I'll show you.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>No, Neil. Please keep your socks on. Thank you. Now, the subject of today's show is penicillin, which was one of the first antibiotics to be discovered. So, Neil, can you tell me how many lives penicillin has saved since its first use as a medicine in 1942? Is it…<br/>a) 20 million?<br/>b) 200 million?<br/>Or c) 2 billion?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, I'll say b) 200 million. That sounds like a good number.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>OK, well, we'll see if you're right or wrong later on in the show. Now, penicillin is a common <strong>antibiotic</strong> – or substance that kills microorganisms – that acts very effectively against certain bacteria. And it was discovered in 1928 by a Scottish scientist called Alexander Fleming who noticed some mould growing on a petri dish of bacteria in his lab, which had a <strong>halo</strong> – or circle – around it where no bacteria were growing.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong><strong>Mould</strong>, by the way, is the soft green fuzzy stuff that grows… for example, in the bottom of my coffee cups when I forget to wash them up, Alice.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>We didn't need to know that, Neil.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>OK, well, moving on, it took decades before scientists learned how to successfully manufacture penicillin. But they got there just in time to treat huge numbers of soldiers in World War Two where so many men were dying from infected wounds.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>And you could have died from your infected toe, Neil, before penicillin!</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>That is a sobering thought, isn't it Alice? Let’s listen now to <span>Christopher Tang, Professor of Cellular Pathology at the University of Oxford, talking about how penicillin has been a game changer in the field of medicine.</span></p><p><strong>INSERT<br/> </strong><strong><span>Christopher Tang, Professor of Cellular Pathology and Professorial Fellow at Exeter College, University of Oxford<br/></span></strong><span>The sort of cancer chemotherapy which we currently use, which immunosuppress people, we couldn't possibly consider that without the use of antibiotics. So not only has penicillin opened the door for treating people with infection, it's also essentially paved the way for modern medicine, modern interventional medicine that we benefit from now.</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><strong><span>Chemotherapy</span></strong><span> is a chemical treatment used to kill cancer cells that also <strong>suppresses</strong></span><span> – or stops – the body's immune system from working. The </span><strong><span>immune system </span></strong><span>is our body's defence against infection and disease. So cancer patients have to take antibiotics to prevent infections that the body can't fight off by itself.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>So the discovery of penicillin paved the way for chemotherapy and other types of medical treatment – and to <strong>pave the way</strong></span><span> means to make something possible. </span>But surely, Alice, there are some bacteria that penicillin doesn't kill?</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>You're right. It only works against bacteria with proteins that are sensitive to penicillin. Other types are less sensitive, and also have systems built into the structure of the cell that sweep out harmful compounds, such as penicillin.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And what about that superbug, what's it called… MS… MR…MSR…?</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>MRSA, Neil. This bacterium was sensitive to penicillin but has developed a <strong>resistance</strong> to it, and to other antibiotics, meaning the drugs can't harm it any more.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Are we returning to the past, then, Alice, where people like me might die from an infected toe?</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well, it's possible, Neil. But drug-resistance isn't new. Here's Professor Steve Jones to tell us more.</p><p><strong><span>INSERT<br/></span></strong><strong><span>Steve Jones, Emeritus Professor of Genetics, University College, London<br/></span></strong><span>Penicillin is not new. It's been around for millions, probably hundreds of millions of years in the soil. And it's because the moulds protect themselves with it. And in fact you find resistance to penicillin in the most unlikely places. You find it for example in corpses from before Columbus in the New World. </span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Professor Steve Jones. So penicillin was discovered in 1928 but it's actually been around for hundreds of millions of years.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Yes. And scientists have been able to test bacteria present in very old <strong>corpses</strong> – or dead bodies – discovered in the New World – that's North and South America – and found that some of it was resistant to penicillin.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>But penicillin resistance is growing, isn't it?</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Yes. These days we overuse penicillin both in agriculture and human medicine, which has given bacteria the chance to adapt and fight back. So it's now up to scientists to adapt penicillin to extend its lifespan, and to search for new types of antibiotics.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>But prevention is better than cure, isn't it? We should all wash our hands more – it's a fantastic way of killing bacteria.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Yes. Good point, Neil, but washing your hands didn't cure your toe, did it? Now, remember I asked you earlier: How many lives has penicillin saved since its first use as a medicine in 1942? Was it… a) 20 million, b) 200 million or c) 2 billion?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I said b) 200 million.<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>And you were right! Penicillin became the most effective life-saving drug in the world, conquering diseases such as tuberculosis, gangrene, pneumonia, diphtheria, and scarlet fever and made Alexander Fleming an international hero for discovering it.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Now, let's hear the words we learned today.<br/>They are:<br/>antibiotic<br/>halo<br/>mould<br/>chemotherapy<br/>suppresses<br/>immune system<br/>pave the way<br/>resistance<br/>corpses</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

Neil and Alice discuss what we need to do to adapt to the inevitable changes ahead., 15 Sep 2016,"<p>Note: This is not a word-for-ward transcript.</p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Alice…</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span><span> </span></strong><span>And I'm Neil. I'm feeling a bit chilly today, Alice. </span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, it is <strong>unseasonably</strong></span><span> cold today – which means not normal for the time of year. But the weather is very unpredictable these days. </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>I know what you mean. </span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Well, global warming is the subject of today's show. </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Is global warming really something to worry about? Some people say that the Earth has warmed up in the past and nothing terrible has happened. </span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>The Earth has warmed up before, but this was the result of things like wobbles in the Earth's orbit, not because of an increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Can we reverse the changes? </span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>No, it's too late, and now we have to find ways to adapt to extreme weather, rising sea levels, and melting polar ice caps. However, we can <strong>mitigate</strong></span><span> greenhouse gas emissions – or make them less harmful. But before we talk more about this, I have a question for you. How much has the average temperature of the Earth's surface increased in the last hundred years? Is it…<br/></span><span>a) 0.85°C?<br/></span><span>b) 1.85°C?<br/></span><span>Or c) 8.5°C?</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>I'm gonna go for the big one a) 8.5°C.</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Well, we'll find out if you got the answer right later on, Neil. But first, do you know any ways to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions?</span></p><p><span> </span><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>I do, actually. An Argentinian company has started collecting cow… emissions and converting them into usable energy.</span></p><p><span> </span><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Well, as the world eats more meat, methane emissions from livestock are actually becoming a bigger climate concern.</span></p><p><span> </span><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And one day's worth of cow emissions provides energy to run a car for 24 hours.</span></p><p><span> </span><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>OK, moving on now, so the world is going to have to adapt to global warming since we can't turn back the clock on climate change. And rich countries have the resources to do this, whilst poorer countries don't. Let's hear from Saleemul Huq, Director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development in Bangladesh, talking about how this problem is being addressed.</span></p><p><span> </span><strong><span>INSERT<br/></span><span> </span></strong><strong><span>Saleemul Huq, Director, International Centre for Climate Change and Development in Bangladesh<br/></span></strong><span>Saleemul Huq: The rich countries have already pledged and promised a hundred billion dollars a year, starting from 2020, to cover all kinds of climate change activities which in climate change are either going to be called mitigation or adaptation.<br/></span><span>Owen Bennett Jones: A year? But that's an enormous sum of money!<br/></span><span>Saleemul Huq: Not that enormous compared to what they gave to the banking system when it collapsed. Climate change is a much bigger problem than the banking crisis.</span></p><p><span> </span><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Saleemul Huq interviewed on the BBC World Service programme Newshour Extra. Well, he says rich countries have <strong>pledged</strong></span><span> – or promised – to deliver a hundred billion dollars a year to help poorer countries adapt to climate change. However, he suggests that this sum could have been larger – since more money than this was donated to resolve the banking crisis.</span></p><p><span> </span><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>For example, after the devastating effects of Hurricane Sandy, New York City invested ten billion dollars on storm defences to protect Manhattan – and Wall Street. </span></p><p><span> </span><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And where lack of water is a problem, countries like Australia, China, and Spain, have built <strong>desalination</strong></span><span> plants, which remove the salt from seawater to produce drinking water. But it's too expensive for developing countries to do this, even though they need them. </span></p><p><span> </span><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>So in relative terms, one billion dollars a year to help poor countries is a small sum of money when compared to their need. Countries like Bangladesh have developed <strong>homegrown</strong></span><span> technologies – which means produced locally – such as harvesting rainwater from their rooftops. </span></p><p><span> </span><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>OK, Alice, and thinking about certain radical proposals for adaptation – did you know there's a Dutch company that wants to build floating cities for us to live in? </span></p><p><span> </span><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>No, I didn't.</span></p><p><span> </span><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yeah. Plans include 15-storey high-rise buildings and floating food production. </span></p><p><span> </span><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>It sounds like it would be incredibly expensive. Has anyone actually built one?</span></p><p><span> </span><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>No, not so far. Let's hear from <span>Mark Maslin, Professor of Climatology at University College London,</span></span><span> talking about why this might be.</span></p><p><span> </span><strong><span>INSERT<br/></span><span> </span></strong><strong><span>Mark Maslin, Professor of Climatology at University College London<br/></span></strong><span>Remember, we're going to have 9.5 billion people by the middle of this century. Now, if you think about it, think about the logistics of building a city, floating, for say, ten million people. And then multiply that up to 60 per cent of 9.5 billion people. OK? So don't think it's really cost-efficient.</span></p><p><span> </span><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>So in practical terms, the logistics of building a large floating city probably couldn't work. It wouldn't be <strong>cost-efficient </strong></span><span>– or good value for the money you paid. </span></p><p><span> </span><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>And <strong>logistics</strong></span><span> means the organization of a complex activity.</span></p><p><span> </span><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>On the other hand, the logistics of teaching farmers in Bangladesh to breed ducks instead of chickens, for example, would be relatively simple and cost-efficient – and since ducks float and chickens don't, it's a sensible adaptation to climate change! </span></p><p><span> </span><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>That's a great example, Neil! Now, I think it's time for the answer to today's quiz question. I asked: How much has the average temperature of the Earth's surface increased in the last hundred years? Is it… a) 0.85°C, b) 1.85°C or c) 8.5°C?</span></p><p><span> </span><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And I said c) 8.5°C and I know I'm wrong.</span></p><p><span> </span><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, I'm afraid you are Neil. The right answer is actually 0.85°C. And did you know that 13 of the 14 warmest years were recorded in the 21st Century?</span></p><p><span> </span><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>I did not know that, Alice.

Is there still a market for DVD rental stores? Alice and Neil discuss old tech and why the US Pentagon still uses floppy disks., 08 Sep 2016,"<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Alice…</p><p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>And I'm Neil.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>We’re talking about old technology today, Neil. Did you use to have any old tech, you know, a Walkman, back in the 1990s? Before music went digital?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>No. I didn't have a Walkman… But I do have a record player.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>I know you like flared trousers, but I didn't realize you were that retro. A <strong>record player</strong>, for those of you who don’t know, is a box with a <strong>turntable</strong> – or turning plate that you put your vinyl records on to play them.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And <strong>retro</strong> means going back to styles and fashions from the past. Well, I love my record player. I have a large collection of vinyl records, as well as cassette tapes that I inherited from my parents…</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong><strong>Vinyl</strong> is the plastic that records are made from. And <strong>cassette tapes</strong> came after records – which are these small plastic cases with audiotape on reels inside them. Well, I don't understand your fondness for out-dated stuff, Neil.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Don't be so quick to dismiss old tech, Alice. There's been a <strong>resurgence</strong> – or new rise in – record sales recently – here in the UK, and in the US. Some DJs have gone back to using them, and new record stores have opened to meet the demand for vinyl.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Really?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, really. In fact, I have a question for you, Alice: How many records were sold in the UK in 2014? Was it…<br/>a) 10,000?<br/>b) 100,000?<br/>Or c) 1 million?</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well, I think it’s b) 100,000.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>We'll find out if you're right or wrong later in the show. For myself, I just think vinyl sounds nicer than digital – has a warmer quality.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>That sounds a bit technical, Neil! Don't you think this retro trend has more to do with nostalgia for the past?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong><strong>Nostalgia</strong> means thinking about the past with a mixture of warm feelings and sadness. Well, yes, I think people who grew up with the old technology probably are nostalgic about it. Let's listen to music journalist Jacqueline Springer talking about cassette tapes and what they mean to her.</p><p><strong>INSERT<br/> </strong><strong><span>Jacqueline Springer, music journalist<br/></span></strong><span>They were audio love letters. They were ways in which you started to carve out your own identity so you know when Dan or I have interviewed people we talk about… we talk to musicians about their impressions and, you know, and their influences, and invariably it was siblings or parents. And you would raid those vinyl albums and you would self-select.</span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Jacqueline Springer there. So she calls cassette tapes 'audio love letters' – because people often <strong>compiled</strong> – or put together – their own collection of songs on tapes and gave them to the boy or girl they liked.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Jacqueline says they recorded songs from their parents' record collections onto tape. And it seems that this process helped create their musical and social identity.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes. I identified with The Rolling Stones, The Clash, and The Sex Pistols when I was a teen. How about your musical identity, Alice?</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well, I was in love with all the boy bands from the 1990s – NSync, Westlife, Backstreet Boys, Take That.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Unbelievable. I can see I need to make you some decent tapes of music from the 90s, Alice.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>I didn’t say I still like boy bands, Neil. I'm not nostalgic for my lost teenage years – unlike you.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Old tech is everywhere. Did you know that the US nuclear weapons force still uses a computer system dating back to the 1970s with 8-inch floppy disks?</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong><strong>Floppy disks</strong>? You mean those flexible plastic computer disks used for storing data magnetically. Well, I can't believe the guys in The Pentagon are nostalgic about floppy disks.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, a Pentagon spokesperson said it would be extremely expensive to update the system and it still works. They plan to do it by 2020 and save a lot of space for sure. You would need more than 130,000 8-inch floppy disks to store 32GB of information.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Wow! This is the equivalent of an average memory stick!<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes. But there are more people out there keen on old tech. How do you think a DVD rental store survives in this era of online movie streaming? Let's listen to Tara Judah, co-director of UK rental store 20th Century Flicks and find out.</p><p><strong>INSERT<br/> </strong><strong><span data-mce-mark=""1"">Tara Judah, Co-director, 20<sup>th</sup></span><span data-mce-mark=""1""> Century Flicks<br/></span></strong><span data-mce-mark=""1"">We've survived because of the experience of coming into this store. Um… It's a very human experience. It's human interaction. People come here because they want to talk to somebody who's really knowledgeable about film. They want to have a recommendation or a conversation about the films they just watch. You know, they really want to discuss those things.</span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So it's back to the idea of human contact – we like compiling lists of music and sharing them with our friends and loved ones. Sharing a playlist through iTunes or Spotify isn't quite the same, though. We like talking people about the films we watch.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>You can always talk to me, Neil. Now how about giving me the answer to today's quiz question?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I asked: How many records were sold in the UK in 2014? Was it… a) 10,000 b) 100,000? Or c) 1 million?</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>I said b) 100,000.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And, Alice, you were in fact totally wrong! The answer is c). Vinyl is booming – in 2014, sales passed 1million albums in the UK for the first time since 1996. The format has been steadily increasing, thanks in part to the popularity of guitar bands, traditionally associated with records.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Now let's hear words we learned today.<br/>They are:<br/>record player<br/>turntable<br/>retro<br/>vinyl<br/>cassette tapes<br/>resurgence<br/>nostalgia<br/>compiled<br/>floppy disk</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

Neil and Alice discuss a very English kind of of language - Cockney Rhyming Slang - and teach you about jargon., 01 Sep 2016,"<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Alice…</p><p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>And I'm Neil.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Could you lend me some dosh, Neil?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Sure. How much do you need?</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>A couple of smackers.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>You're sounding strange today, Alice.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Yes, I know, Neil. <strong>Slang</strong> – or informal language used by a particular group – is the subject of today's show, and I was just demonstrating a couple of slang words that mean 'money'. <strong>Dosh</strong> is a general term for money and a <strong>smacker</strong> is a British pound or US dollar.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>OK, so <strong>Cockney Rhyming Slang</strong> is a type of slang. It's a coded language invented in the 19th Century by Cockneys so they could speak in front of the police without being understood. And still on the subject of money, I have a question for you, Alice.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>OK.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>What's Cockney Rhyming Slang for 'money'? Is it…<br/>a) bread?<br/>b) honey?<br/>Or c) dough?</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>I think it's a) bread. I bet you didn't know, Neil, that I'm a Cockney.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I don't Adam and Eve it, Alice! That's a pork pie!</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>'Adam and Eve' means 'believe' and 'pork pie' means… 'lie'! Actually, you're right. I'm not a Cockney.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>To be considered a Cockney, you need to be born within hearing distance of the bells of St Mary-le-Bow church in what is now the City of London.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Indeed. Now, slang, as we've said, is <strong>colloquial</strong> – or informal – language. And it's characteristic of specific social groups. We usually use it in informal conversation rather than in writing or more formal situations, like a job interview.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>We change the way we speak so that what we say is appropriate for a particular situation. So you surprised me, earlier, Alice, by talking about 'dosh' and 'smackers' because it didn't seem appropriate for presenting the show.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Slang use is often <strong>frowned upon</strong> – or disapproved of. Let's listen to Jonathan Green, a lexicographer of slang, talking about who uses slang and how this has changed. Here he is on the Radio 4 programme Word of Mouth.</p><p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Jonathan Green, lexicographer of slang<br/></strong>Slang does have a bad reputation and I would say this comes from its earliest collection, which was of criminal slang in the 1500s in the 16th century, and it was associated with bad people, and inevitably that has lingered. But now in the last 40 or 50 years it's changed. The definitions tend to stress 'different' and 'jocular', 'funny', 'humorous', 'inventive', that kind of thing.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So we have records of 16th Century slang in collections – or dictionaries. Words used by criminals as a code so they could talk without being understood. And this bad reputation has <strong>lingered</strong> – or been slow to disappear.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>But for the last 50 years we've been using slang to be funny and creative as well as to show belonging to a particular group. And apparently we're very creative when talking about drinking and being drunk. The slang word <strong>booze</strong> – meaning 'alcohol' – comes from the 13th Century Dutch word, 'būsen'.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And there are hundreds of slang expressions to talk about drink and being drunk: 'on the sauce', 'in your cups', 'half cut', 'hammered', 'squiffy', 'tipsy', 'wasted', 'legless', and many many more that are far too rude to mention in this programme.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Yes. So, while these terms might not be strictly acceptable – or appropriate in formal contexts they aren't offensive, they are often amusing and help people bond in social groups.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>By contrast, <strong>swear</strong> words or <strong>profanity</strong> – means 'rude language that offends or upsets people'. And I'm not going to give any examples because that would be inappropriate and impolite, Alice.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>OK, let's listen now to Jonathan Green and presenter Michael Rosen talking about jargon – another type of in-group language.</p><p><strong>INSERT<br/> </strong><strong>Jonathan Green, lexicographer of slang, and Michael Rosen, Presenter, Word of Mouth, Radio 4<br/></strong>JG: Jargon is what I would call is small 'o' occupational, small 'p' professional. It's closed off environments. You get legal jargon, you get naval jargon, I've been reading Patrick O'Brien recently and that's awash with futtock plates and fiddying the decks.<br/>MR: This is radio 4 Jonathan, be careful!</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Jonathan Green in another segment of the BBC Radio 4 programme Word of Mouth. So he says jargon is occupational and professional, meaning people speak it at work, for example, lawyers and sailors. A futtock plate is, I believe, an iron plate attached to the top of a ship's mast. But I don't know much about this subject.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>That's the idea, though – <strong>jargon</strong> is the technical language belonging to a specific group. And to <strong>outsiders</strong> this jargon is often hard to understand.<br/> <br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes and here in the studio I can use all the radio jargon that I like. Look at my faders here, Alice. Going down and up and up and I'm just testing our levels…</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Come on, live the fader alone. It controls the level of sound on a studio deck. Now it's time for the answer to today's quiz question, Neil.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I asked you: What's Cockney Rhyming Slang for money? Is it… a) bread, b) honey or c) dough?</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>And I said a) bread.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And you were right, Alice! Cockney Rhyming Slang uses just the first word of a phrase that rhymes with a word we're trying to disguise. So 'money' becomes 'bread and honey' but we just say 'bread'.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>OK, so let's recap on the words we've learned today. They are:<br/>slang<br/>dosh<br/>smacker<br/>Cockney Rhyming Slang<br/>colloquial<br/>frowned upon<br/>lingered<br/>booze<br/>swear<br/>profanity<br/>jargon</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

I'm Alice…</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span><span> </span></strong><span>And I'm Neil. </span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Neil, how often do you do the washing up at home?</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Oh, you know, on special occasions – like after a Christmas lunch!</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>That's terrible, Neil!</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, domestic chores are the subject of today's show. And you know what? I'm not very good at them. </span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><strong><span>Domestic</span></strong><span> means to do with the family or home and a <strong>chore</strong></span><span> is a boring job that needs doing. Not being good at chores sounds like a bad excuse for avoiding housework, Neil. </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>I suppose you're right. But I wasn't surprised to learn that on average women spend several more hours a day doing chores at home than men. Maybe men have a higher threshold for dirt and untidiness. </span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Do you have a high threshold, Neil?</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yes. And <strong>threshold</strong></span><span> means the point at which you begin to feel something. It takes a lot of dirt and untidiness to make me feel I need to start clearing up.</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>OK, so my question for you today, Neil, is: What percentage of men take responsibility for giving the house a weekly clean, according to a recent online survey by the UK organization, Mumsnet? Is it…<br/></span><span>a) 1%?<br/></span><span>b) 5%?<br/></span><span>Or c) 10%?</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Hmm. Those figures all sound low. But I'll assume that not all men are like me, and say c) 10%.</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Well, we'll see if you're being optimistic with your answer later on in the show. So now let's listen to a conversation between BBC reporter Geoff Byrd and his wife Sarah. In an interview to a BBC presenter they discuss Sarah's <strong>aversion </strong>to</span><span> – or strong dislike of domestic chores.</span></p><p><strong><span>INSERT<br/></span><span> BBC reporter Geoff Byrd and his wife Sarah<br/></span></strong><span>SB: The thing is, it's a boring thing. You should just do the minimum amount you need to do to get by. That is my policy. I would say I definitely work harder than you do, and therefore have less time. Have we just switched round in terms of our roles?<br/></span><span>GB: Probably. Yeah. And that's no bad thing. Go the revolution!</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Sarah and Geoff there. In their household, Geoff does more chores because Sarah finds them boring and she also does more paid work. She thinks people should do the <strong>minimum</strong></span><span> amount of housework – or least amount needed – to get by. </span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>And <strong>to</strong></span><span> </span><strong><span>get by</span></strong><span> means to achieve something with difficulty. </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>So Geoff does most of the cooking and cleaning in their house – which as we discussed earlier on, isn't usually the case for men. He doesn't seem to mind, though, does he?</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>That's right. He says switching roles is <strong>no bad thing</strong></span><span> – in other words, it's a good thing!</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yey. Go the revolution! Just don't include me, because I'm with Sarah. I hate housework.</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>OK, well let's assume that Sarah and Geoff aren't typical of most families, and consider the serious implications of women doing more of the household chores. Some domestic tasks can be strongly <strong>gendered</strong></span><span> – or specific to one sex. For example, doing the laundry, organizing your children's school and social lives are often jobs that women do.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>But putting the rubbish out or fixing a leaky tap – those are work many people still see as men's jobs.</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Well, I put the rubbish bins out in my household, Neil. Anyway, this means women often spend significantly more time doing chores at home, juggling this with paid work.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, that sounds like a lot. I can see I'm going to have to get my pinny on a bit more at home, Alice.</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>I hope you do, Neil, because a bit more give and take at home could help improve a working mum's prospects of getting promoted at work and earning more. And for those of you unfamiliar with the word,<strong> pinny</strong></span><span> – or </span><strong><span>pinafore</span></strong><span> – means apron.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And<strong> give and take</strong></span><span> means compromise.</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Let's hear now from Professor Jonathan Gershuny, co-director at the Centre for Time Use Research at Oxford University, talking about why it's important to protect your <strong>earning capacity</strong></span><span> – or ability to earn money.</span></p><p><strong><span>INSERT<br/></span><span> Professor Jonathan Gershuny, co-director at the Centre for Time Use Research at Oxford University<br/></span></strong><span>Nowadays, half of all marriages fail… you know… it's not a reasonable expectation that you're going to stay married to the same chap indefinitely. And if under these circumstances you've been out of the labour force looking after the kids while he builds up his earnings capacity by working long hours at work and then he runs off with his secretary, well he departs with his earnings power, and you're left with the baby.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Professor Jonathan Gershuny. But actually, these days, quite a few men take care of the children while their wives or partners work full time. </span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>And she might run off with her secretary. But the main issue here is that both partners – whether male or female – should protect their earnings capacity. Now, I think it's time for the answer to today's quiz question, Neil. I asked you: What percentage of men take responsibility for giving the house a weekly clean, according to a recent online survey by the UK organization, Mumsnet? Is it… a) 1%, b) 5% or c) 10%?</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>I said c) 10%. </span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>And you were wrong, I'm afraid, Neil! The answer is actually b) 5%. Mumsnet asked nearly 1,000 working mothers about the distribution of tasks in their homes. </span><span>Now, can we hear the words we learned today, please?</span></p><p><span> </span><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Sure.

I'm Alice…</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span><span> </span></strong><span>And I'm Neil. </span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>What are you eating, Neil? </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>It's a chocolate chip muffin.</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>How many calories do you think it contains?</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>I have no idea.<br/><br/></span><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Check the packet.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>It's hard to find the calorie content amongst all the other information here. Ah, here we go: 450. </span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>That's a lot! Are you sure you should be eating that? </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Why not? I expect I cycled off quite a few calories on the way to work.</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Well, that depends on the length of your journey and how much energy you <strong>expended</strong></span><span> – or used up. Now, on today's show we're talking about food and the exercise it takes to burn off calories. And I have a question for you, Neil: How long would you have to walk to burn off the calories in a quarter of a large pizza? Is it…<br/></span><span>a) 33 minutes?<br/></span><span>b) 53 minutes?<br/></span><span>c) 83 minutes?</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>I'll go for a) 33 minutes. That sounds quite enough considering if you ate the whole pizza it would mean walking for 132 minutes to <strong>burn off</strong></span><span> – or use – the calories. And that's over two hours!</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Well, we'll find out later on whether you got the answer right or not, Neil. But be warned – people are bad at estimating how many calories there are in food. Now, the Royal Society for Public Health here in the UK is concerned that people don't read the information on food packaging because the text is so <strong>dense</strong></span><span> – it means, tightly packed. </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, I never look at food labelling when I'm shopping for food. How about you, Alice? </span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Well, personally, I like to make an informed choice about what I put in my body, Neil! And <strong>informed</strong></span><span> means based on an understanding of the facts. So I spend a lot of time reading the packaging. And I think the current traffic lights are a great idea.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Traffic lights? What are you talking about?</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>It's where food content is colour-coded red, orange or green – like traffic lights – depending on its percentage of fat, sugar, and salt. So you can see at a glance which pizza on the supermarket shelf is better for you. This helps the consumer to make an informed choice.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>To <strong>see at a glance</strong></span><span> means to understand something immediately. Well, my informed choice is based on which pizza has the most pepperoni on it. I had no idea food companies were putting traffic lights on their food packaging! </span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, and that's not all, Neil. There are now plans to put an <strong>icon</strong></span><span> – or simple picture – of someone running plus the time it would take to burn off the calories contained in a particular food item on the front of packaging. Let's hear what some consumers on the streets of London thought about this idea.</span></p><p><strong><span>INSERT<br/>People in London</span></strong><strong><span><br/></span><span> </span></strong><span>MAN: I would think twice about buying crisps if I have to run 19 minutes just to burn the calories I ate.<br/></span><span>WOMAN: I'd either consider working out those 19 minutes or not eating the crisps at all.</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Two people who would think twice about whether to buy crisps if they knew how long it would take to burn off the calories.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And <strong>think twice</strong></span><span> means to think carefully about doing something before you do it. But, to be honest, I want freedom to do what I feel like. Even if they put a label on the food I think </span><span>I'd exercise if I wanted to exercise, but I think I'd still have a packet of crisps if I wanted a packet of crisps.</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>That's fine so long as you are clear about how active you need to be to eat what you do and not put on weight. </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>But a healthy diet isn't just about calories is it? I wouldn't need to cycle to work to burn off a diet cola, but drinking a fresh orange juice would be a healthier choice – even though it contains more calories.</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Well, that's a good point. Let's listen now to Shirley Cramer, Chief Executive at the Royal Society for Public Health, talking about why she thinks the new labelling is necessary.</span></p><p><strong><span>INSERT<br/></span><span> Shirley Cramer, Chief Executive, Royal Society for Public Health<br/></span></strong><span>We've got 60% of the UK population either overweight or obese. We have a very, very urgent problem. We have a growing population, literally, and we need to have a lot of tools in our toolbox, a lot of new strategies, I think, in order to support people to make good choices. </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Shirley Cramer of the Royal Society of Public Health. So, she says we need lots of <strong>tools </strong></span><span>– or strategies –</span><span>to help tackle obesity in the UK. And linking energy content in food to physical activity is just one tool in the toolbox, so to speak.</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Indeed. Now, I think it's time for the answer to today's quiz question, Neil. I asked you: How long would you have to walk to burn off the calories in a quarter of a large pizza? Is it… a) 33 minutes? b) 53 minutes? Or c) 83 minutes?</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And I said a) 33 minutes.<br/><br/></span><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>And you underestimated, I'm afraid, Neil! The answer is c) 83 minutes. This figures comes from Shirley Cramer, Chief Executive of the Royal Society for Public Health. Writing in the British Medical Journal, she argues that food should be labelled with the equivalent exercise needed to burn off its calories. This would give consumers an immediate link between food's energy content and physical activity that might help to reduce obesity.<br/><br/></span><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Note, Alice, that I've put my muffin to one side. You've convinced me to eat more healthily and I'll be eating a green salad for lunch. <br/><br/></span><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>I'll believe that when I see it, Neil.<br/></span><span>OK, here are the words we learned today:<br/></span><span>expended<br/></span><span>burn off<br/></span><span>dense<br/></span><span>informed<br/></span><span>see at a glance<br/></span><span>icon<br/></span><span>think twice<br/></span><span>tool</span></p><p><span> </span><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, that's the end of this edition of 6 Minute English.

I'm Alice…</p><p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>And I'm Neil. Have you ever written any poetry, Alice?</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>No. Have you?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Oh yes. I've got a sheaf of poems from my youth.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>A <strong>sheaf</strong> of something means a bundle of things, particularly paper. What about now? Are you still writing?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>No, my creative juices have dried up.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>What a shame! I would have liked to hear some of your poems! <strong>Creative juices</strong> means a flow of ideas and the subject of today's show is creativity and <strong>writer's block</strong> – which means not being able to write because of a psychological problem.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So not like tennis elbow or golfer's knee, then.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>No, Neil, because a psychological problem refers to the mind not the body. And whilst some people view writer's block as nonsense others believe it is a serious psychological condition that can get better with treatment.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, I have a question for you, Alice. How does author of the Da Vinci Code, Dan Brown, deal with writer's block? Does he…<br/>a) hang upside down from the ceiling in gravity boots?<br/>b) clean his 6-bedroom house from top to bottom with a toothbrush?<br/>Or c) run a half-marathon listening to opera music by Richard Wagner?</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>I think it's c) run a half-marathon listening to Wagner. Exercise and music might get your creative juices flowing again.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, we'll find out whether you got the right answer later on in the show. <span>But first, Alice, can you tell us where the term writer's block comes from?</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Well, the term was <strong>coined</strong></span><span> – or invented – in 1950 by a Viennese psychoanalyst Edmund Bergler. Let's</span> listen to <span>Zachary Leader, Professor of English Literature at Roehampton University talking about the psychoanalytic theory of writer's block.</span></p><p><strong>INSERT<br/> </strong><strong><span>Zachary Leader, Professor of English Literature at Roehampton University<br/></span></strong><span>Before writers were blocked the other metaphors that were used were things like 'drying up' … or 'being frozen' or 'stuck in a rut' and so forth. And the difference between being blocked and drying up is that in the case of blockage the problem is externalised and objectified – it's not yourself that's the problem – it's something that's outside you like an obstacle or an impediment – something that you could really cut away, and as a consequence a cure like a growth or a foreign body.</span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So writer's block is a metaphor for an obstacle – something external rather than internal inside of you – that's preventing you from working. Doesn't that sound like an excuse for not doing anything, Alice? 'It's not my fault – this impediment thing is getting in the way'.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Yes. Well, <strong>impediment</strong> is another word for obstacle. But how do you cut away a foreign body that isn't actually there?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I suppose psychoanalysts have an answer for that. But seriously, I think writers probably do have a hard time. You can sit down at your desk every morning at 9 o'clock to write but that doesn't mean you're going to think of things to say. Though we're never stuck for words, are we?</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Not usually, Neil, no. But did you know that the Ancient Greeks had <strong>Muses</strong> – or goddesses of creativity – to help them?<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So… Beyoncé isn't a real muse? I've heard people say, you know, 'Beyoncé is my muse; she's such a great singer, songwriter, dancer, role model!'</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong><span>Well, these days, 'muse' can refer to anyone who inspires an artist, writer, or musician</span>. But in Ancient Greece, there<span> were nine Muses – and depending on what type of creative thing you did – philosophy, poetry, science and so on – you <strong>invoked</strong></span><span> – or called upon – that particular Muse to inspire you.<br/><br/></span><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>I call upon you, oh Alice, to enlighten us with more information about the Greek Muses.</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Alright then. So let's listen to Angie Hobbs instead. She's Professor of the Public Understanding of Philosophy, University of Sheffield here in the UK – and here she is now, talking about what the Greek Muses symbolized.</span></p><p><strong>INSERT<br/> </strong><strong><span>Angie Hobbs, Professor of the Public Understanding of Philosophy, University of Sheffield<br/></span></strong><span>We've seen that the Muses were connected to running water, to springs, to fountains, fluidity. So if you're musing, you are letting your mind wander, you're opening yourself up to new influences and new ideas, and not thinking in too structured a way. </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Musing, letting your mind wander, thinking in a fluid, unstructured way – that all sounds very pleasant – maybe I should have another go at writing. </span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Well, according to research, some people are better at mind wandering and opening themselves up to new ideas than others. Their minds work differently – they have more dopamine in the thalamus region of the brain. </span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong><span>The <strong>thalamus</strong></span><span> controls consciousness, sleep and the senses and </span><strong>dopamine</strong> is the feel-good chemical in the brain<span>. Is that right?</span></p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Yes, and having more dopamine in the thalamus enables some people to see the world in a different way – and they express this creatively – through science, music, the arts. Now, before you start musing on how much dopamine you have in your brain, Neil, perhaps you can tell us the answer to today's quiz question?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I asked: How does author of the <em>Da Vinci Code</em>, Dan Brown, deal with writer's block? Does he…<br/>a) hang upside down from the ceiling in gravity boots?<br/>b) clean his 6-bedroom house from top to bottom with a toothbrush?<br/>Or c) run a half-marathon listening to opera music by Richard Wagner?</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>And I said c) run a half-marathon listening to opera music by Richard Wagner.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And you were wrong, Alice! The answer is a) hang upside down from the ceiling in gravity boots.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Really?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes.

Which words and grammar will still be there? And which will have been lost? Alice and Neil make some educated guesses!, 04 Aug 2016,"<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript.</p><p><span> </span><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Alice…</span></p><p><span> </span><strong><span>Neil<br/></span><span> </span></strong><span>And I'm Neil. So Alice, can you think of an example of how the English we speak is changing?</span></p><p><span> </span><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, I can – teenagers saying 'like' all the time…</span></p><p><span> </span><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Oh, that's, like, really like annoying, like? </span></p><p><span> </span><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Well, the subject of today's show is how and why the English language is changing. And teenagers definitely have their own code – including text speak when they're on the internet or using their phones. Fomo, bae, plos – do you have any idea what those terms mean, Neil? </span></p><p><span> </span><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>I've got no idea what you're talking about, Alice. They're pretty <strong>baffling</strong></span><span> – and that means 'hard to understand'. But that's the idea, isn't it? We oldies aren't supposed to understand!</span></p><p><span> </span><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, exactly! Apparently, 'plos' means 'parents looking over shoulder' – which proves your point! Text speak is a lot to do with inventing cool new terms – and these change quickly. In a year, or even six months time, words that were once popular, have disappeared completely.</span></p><p><span> </span><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>OK, I have a quiz question forming in my mind, Alice – so I hope you're feeling up to the challenge, Alice. Can you tell me, what kinds of words are slow to change? Is it...<br/></span><span>a) nouns?<br/></span><span>b) pronouns?<br/></span><span>Or c) adjectives?</span></p><p><span> </span><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>I think it's a) nouns. The way we name things probably doesn't change that quickly. </span></p><p><span> </span><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>We shall find out if you are right or wrong later on in the show. But let's think about English grammar for a minute, and what changes are occurring here. </span></p><p><span> </span><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>I noticed you said 'shall' there, Neil. And to my ear, that sounds pretty old fashioned.</span></p><p><span> </span><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And you're very right, Alice. The modal verb 'shall' is <strong>on the way out</strong></span><span> – meaning it's disappearing. Why do you think that is?</span></p><p><span> </span><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Well, perhaps it's because 'will' sounds more natural these days. Let's listen to linguist Bas Aarts, talking to writer and presenter, Michael Rosen on the BBC Radio 4 programme <em>Word of Mouth</em></span><span>, </span><span>for his explanation.</span></p><p><span> </span><strong><span>INSERT<br/></span><span> </span></strong><strong><span>Presenter Michael Rosen and Bas Aarts, Professor of English linguistics at University College London<br/></span></strong><span>MR: Why would we lose 'shall'? I mean, if especially as we hold it in the interrogative. We say, you know, 'Shall we go swimming'?<br/></span><span>BA: Well, because it's in competition with 'will'. If you have two words that more or less express the same meaning, one of the two is going to be pushed out of the language. And in this case, it's 'shall'.</span></p><p><span> </span><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Bas Aarts there. And <strong>interrogative</strong></span><span> means 'a question'. So it's not just in nature that we get survival of the fittest – you know, the struggle for life – it happens in language too. Similar words are competing with each other, and some lose while others </span><strong><span>win out</span></strong><span> – or succeed after a fight. Do you know of any other modal verbs that are on their way out, Alice?</span></p><p><span> </span><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Yes – 'must' is declining rapidly.  </span></p><p><span> </span><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Why's that?</span></p><p><span> </span><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>'Must' sounds authoritarian, and people are choosing to express <strong>obligation</strong></span><span> – or having a duty to do something – in different ways.</span></p><p><span> </span><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>OK, <strong>authoritarian</strong></span><span> means 'demanding that people obey you'. For example: Alice, you must move on to the next point, now!</span></p><p><span> </span><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Oh, you scared me a bit there, Neil!</span></p><p><span> </span><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Exactly. I can see why people are <strong>shying away from</strong></span><span> – or avoiding – 'must'. It sounds nicer to soften obligation by saying things like, 'You </span><em><span>might</span></em><span> want to move on to the next point now, Alice.'</span></p><p><span> </span><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>OK, then, I shall. Let's talk about tenses. <strong>Progressive</strong></span><span> tenses – formed from the verb </span><em><span>be</span></em><span> and the suffix –</span><em><span>ing</span></em><span> – are usually used for ongoing situations, for example, 'I'm doing the show with Neil at the moment'. But its use has been increasing rapidly. Let's listen to Michael Rosen and Bas Aarts again talking about this.</span></p><p><span> </span><strong><span>INSERT<br/></span><span> </span></strong><strong><span>Presenter Michael Rosen and Bas Aarts, Professor of English linguistics at University College London <br/></span></strong><span>BA: It started increasing dramatically in the 19th </span><span>century and has continued to rise in the present day.<br/></span><span>MR: I think that's a cue for me to say, 'I'm loving it', is that right?<br/></span><span>BA: Well, that is one of the constructions that is coming in, I mean, I sometimes call it the Big Mac progressive because of course McDonald's use that.</span></p><p><span data-mce-mark=""1""> </span><strong><span data-mce-mark=""1"">Neil<br/></span></strong><span data-mce-mark=""1"">In this segment of the BBC Radio 4 programme <em>Word of Mouth</em></span><span data-mce-mark=""1"">, Michael Rosen quotes the progressive form 'I'm loving it' – a slogan used by an American fast-food chain in its advertising campaign.</span></p><p><span> </span><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>The verb 'love' is a <strong>stative</strong></span><span> verb. It expresses a state of being – as opposed to doing – and is traditionally used in the simple form, for example, 'I love it'. </span><span>But these days, people are using stative verbs in the progressive more and more.</span></p><p><span> </span><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>I'm hearing what you're saying, Alice! Now, I think it's time for the answer to today's quiz question. I asked you: What kinds of words are slow to change? Is it… a) nouns, b) pronouns or c) adjectives?</span></p><p><span> </span><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>I said a) nouns.</span></p><p><span> </span><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And you were wrong, Alice! According to Professor Mark Pagel, evolutionary biologist at Reading University in the UK, pronouns like 'I' and 'you' and 'we' evolve slowly – a thousand years ago we would be using similar or sometimes identical sounds. Similarly, number words evolve very slowly – our ancestors were using related sounds a thousand or perhaps even two thousand years ago. Whereas nouns and adjectives get replaced quite rapidly – and in five hundred years or so we'll probably be using different words to the ones we use now.</span></p><p><span> </span><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Well, I got that completely wrong then! Who knew that one, two, three would have such staying power?</span></p><p><span> </span><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>I suppose numbers are pretty fundamental to our day-to-day lives – sort of part of who we are. </span></p><p><span></span><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>OK, let's hear the - hopefully - more permanent words we learned today.<br/><br/></span><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>There were:<br/></span><span>baffling<br/></span><span>on the way out<br/></span><span>interrogative<br/></span><span>win out<br/></span><span>obligation<br/></span><span>authoritarian<br/></span><span>shying away from<br/></span><span>progressive<br/></span><span>stative<br/><br/></span><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

I'm Alice…<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>And I'm Neil.<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>So, Neil, what's the best holiday you've ever had?<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>That would be scuba diving on the Great Barrier Reef off the coast of Australia. It was awesome! I saw sharks, sea turtles, manta rays... <br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>I certainly don't like the idea of coming nose to nose with a shark! But then diving isn't really my thing. I'm more into cultural holidays – you know, visiting the ruins of ancient civilisations.<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>That's very worthy, Alice. But tourists are actually damaging a number of important sites around the world – tramping around, dropping litter, scribbling graffiti everywhere…<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>I would never drop litter or scribble graffiti!<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, we're talking about world heritage sites today, which are places UNESCO considers to be at risk from various threats and in need of protection. <strong>Heritage</strong> means the things a society considers important to its history and culture, for example art, buildings, or natural sites such as the Grand Canyon in the United States.<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>And the environment poses a number of different threats. So, Neil, can you tell me which sea creature is a potential threat to the Great Barrier Reef's ecosystem? Is it a … <br/>a) starfish?<br/>b) jellyfish?<br/>Or c) cuttlefish?<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I will go for b) jellyfish. I'm no expert on marine life, but I have eaten jellyfish and I haven't eaten the other ones.<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Oh, I see. Well, we'll find out later on if you are an expert or not. But let's listen now to BBC reporter Roger Harrabin talking about other types of threat to heritage sites. See how many you can spot!<br/><br/><strong>INSERT<br/> Roger Harrabin, BBC reporter<br/></strong>The most precious wonders of the natural world – Australia's Great Barrier Reef, America's spectacular Grand Canyon, the Barrier Reef of Belize in South America, second biggest on Earth – all facing threats from humans. The Great Barrier Reef is attracting urgent concern. There's a huge battle over mining and port development. A giant coalmine has just been given the go-ahead by the Queensland government even though scientists warn it may damage the Reef.<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>That's the BBC's Roger Harrabin. Well, I spotted a couple of threats to heritage sites there – mining and port development. Now, any type of industrial activity can harm them by, for example, encroaching on the natural habitat of animals and plants living there, or by polluting the water that flows into the site.<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong><strong>Mining</strong> is the process of extracting coal or other minerals from the ground, and if you <strong>encroach on something</strong>, it means you move beyond acceptable limits. The interesting thing is that world heritage sites only constitute 0.5% of the Earth's surface – so why can't people do their mining and industrial development on the remaining 99.5%!<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>But there is one human industry that can actually be beneficial for precious sites: tourism.<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>But you said earlier that tourism was bad for heritage sites.<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I know. And I was right, up to a point. World heritage sites are some of tourism's main attractions, and more and more people are visiting them. So it's all about getting the balance right between generating money to maintain and restore the sites and minimizing the impact of tourist activities.<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Such as littering and graffiti.<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Exactly. And the term for this is <strong>sustainable</strong> <strong>tourism</strong> – or tourism designed to have a low impact on the local culture and the environment, while generating employment for local people.<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>So UNESCO is working to direct governments, site managers and visitors towards sustainable tourism practices in order to keep our world's natural and cultural heritage safe for future generations.<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Wow, you can really talk the talk, Alice. You should work for UNESCO! OK, let's move on now, and listen to Paul Crocombe, of the Snorkelling and Diving Company in Townsville, Queensland, Australia, giving his view on how the Great Barrier Reef will cope with threats to its survival.<br/><br/><strong>INSERT<br/> Paul Crocombe, Snorkelling and diving company, Townsville, Queensland, Australia<br/></strong>The Reef's fairly dynamic, it's been through a couple of ice ages, and is still here, so its resilience will ensure that the Reef is still here in years to come. But the species diversity and the… the visual aesthetics of the Reef may change quite considerably, especially if we get an increase in sea temperature, an increase in carbon dioxide in the water, and things like that.<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Paul Crocombe describes the Reef as 'dynamic' and 'resilient'.<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong><strong>Dynamic</strong> means active or capable of changing and <strong>resilience</strong> means the ability to recover or adapt to change – which all sounds good. But Paul also says that the <strong>species diversity</strong> – the range of plants and animals – may change.<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>For example, a rise in sea temperature would cause a rise in carbon dioxide levels – and this could have a big impact on both the species diversity and the Reef's <strong>visual aesthetic</strong> – or the way it looks.<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>OK, I think it's time now for the answer to today's quiz question, Alice.<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Yes, I think so too. OK, so, I asked you: Which sea creature poses a potential threat to the Great Barrier Reef's ecosystem? Is it a type of …  a) starfish, b) jellyfish or c) cuttlefish?<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I said b) jellyfish.<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>And you got stung, I'm afraid, Neil!<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Ouch!<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>The answer is starfish. The crown-of-thorns starfish preys on coral and large outbreaks of these starfish can devastate reefs. Now, can you remind us of some of today's vocabulary, Neil?<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Sure:<br/>heritage<br/>encroach on something<br/>sustainable tourism<br/>dynamic<br/>resilience<br/>species diversity<br/>visual aesthetic<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

And why do we perceive time differently in different circumstances? Neil and Alice discuss how our perception of time is linked to the speed our brains create memories., 21 Jul 2016,"<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript.<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Alice…<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>And I'm Neil. Did you have a good weekend, Alice?<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Yes, but it <strong>flew by</strong> – which means it went quickly – and here we are again, back at work!<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Hm. I know what you mean. Though I must say, time really <strong>dragged</strong> for me – and that means it went slowly. I was on a train, which broke down.<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Oh dear!</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And it felt like it took forever to arrive – though actually it was only delayed only by one hour.<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well, today we're talking about our <strong>perception</strong> of – or the way we see – time. It's true that when we're busy doing lots of things, time flies by.<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And when we're bored or have nothing to do, it drags. And I didn't have anything to do on the train. Do you think time flows at the same rate for everyone – even animals? My cat doesn't get bored doing nothing all day. I wonder if time drags for her sometimes?<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Good question! Did you know, Neil, that, according to a new study, smaller animals perceive time as if it is passing in slow motion?<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>That sounds weird. Do you think they hear us like this: t…a…l…k…i…n…g   s…l…o…w…l…y…?<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Don't be silly, Neil! What I meant was that small animals such as insects and small birds can observe more detail in a certain period of time – for example, a second – than larger animals.<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And how does this help them, exactly? It sounds like the day would really drag if every second got stretched out like that!<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>It helps them by giving them time to escape larger predators. Now, I have a question for you, Neil. Can you tell me roughly how much more quickly a fly's eye can react than a human eye? Is it …<br/>a) twice as quickly?<br/>b) four times as quickly?<br/>Or c) ten times as quickly?<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, I'll go for c) ten times. Flies are pretty <strong>nippy</strong> – and that's another word for quick.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Yes. Well, we'll find out later on if you got the answer right or not. Now, small animals can typically process more visual information than we can. But in a dangerous situation our brains can work in overdrive to process information more quickly. And <strong>overdrive</strong> means a state of extreme activity. Let's listen to Raza Rumi, a writer and broadcaster in Pakistan, talking about the unusual way his brain worked when gunmen opened fire on him in his car.<br/><br/><strong>INSERT<br/> </strong><strong>Raza Rumi, writer and broadcaster, Pakistan<br/></strong>It lasted for a few minutes – but to me that particular incident feels like it was for hours. I think my brain was working in a very strange way. Parallel and multiple thoughts and streams of consciousness were sort of running along: 'I have to save my head because if I get a bullet in my brain I'm dead.' And at the same time, 'Was it all worth it?' And, 'Alas, what a short life it was, it was lovely.' I was petrified that I was going to die.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Raza Rumi there. So, he was <strong>petrified</strong> by the attack – which means extremely frightened. As a result, his brain started working in a strange way. He was thinking and feeling lots of different things at the same time.<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>That's right – he remembers thinking practical thoughts like, 'I have to save my head'.<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>But <strong>in parallel</strong> – or at the same time – he also remembers having philosophical thoughts, such as: What a short life it was, it was lovely.<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Have you ever been in a dangerous situation where your brain went into overdrive, Neil?<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, I was ten years old and I fell backwards out of a big tree in our garden.<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Oh no!<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yeah. I have a vivid memory of the sun flashing above me, and the clouds moving across the sky, and the leaves rustling in the tree above me – my mum was screaming through the kitchen window as she saw me fall. I experienced so much in the space of just a few seconds, just like Raza Rumi describes.<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Yes. A <strong>vivid</strong> memory, by the way, is clear and detailed. Oh, poor Neil! Did you hurt yourself?<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Some big bruises – but no broken bones.<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Glad to hear it. Now, it's a strange trick of memory that in a scary situation your brain starts to record everything in great detail. And the more memory you have of an event, the longer you believe it took. This idea explains why children often feel that time is passing slowly – because their experiences are new, and they are creating lots of new memories.<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Whereas boring grown-ups like us are following routines that don't require new memories because they're so familiar. But let's listen to Claudia Hammond, author of <em>Time Warp</em>ed, talking about how we can stretch time and make our days feel longer – in a good way!<br/><br/><strong>INSERT<br/> </strong><strong><span>Claudia Hammond, author of <em>Time Warped<br/></em></span></strong><span>If you can spend your weekend filling it with loads of new different activities, it'll go fast, at the time, because you're having fun. But when you look back, say, on Sunday night, and you've got to go to work next day, it will feel as if your weekend was long, because you filled it with new memories.<br/><br/></span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>We should do that, this weekend, Neil. What do you think?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Definitely.

Alice and Neil discuss Neil's attempt at town planning and how to make cities 'smart'. ", 14 Jul 2016,"<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript.<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Alice…<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>And I'm Neil.<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Have you ever played SimCity, Neil – the city-building computer game?<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, but I wasn't very good at it. I didn't build enough houses, which created a lot of homeless Sims – those are the characters in the game. And then I didn't deal effectively with a flood…<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Really? Well, I suppose managing a city is quite a challenge – which is the subject of today's show: cities of the future – an important subject as so many of us now live in urban areas. I want to start with our quiz question: What is the percentage of the world's population that will be living in cities in 2050? We're dealing with approximates here. Is it…<br/>a) 10%?<br/>b) 50%?<br/>Or c) 70%?<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I think that it's a) 10%.<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well, we'll find out if you're right or wrong later on in the show. Now, you've encountered a couple of issues that might face urban planners when designing a city, Neil – housing and dealing with a flood. Can you think of any others?<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes. Having decent cycle lanes. Good transport networks are very important.<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Yes indeed, and if people could get around easily on foot, or by bike, or by public transport, roads would be less <strong>congested</strong> – or overcrowded – and less polluted. That sounds rather utopian to me though.<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>A <strong>utopia</strong> is an imaginary place where everything is perfect. But Copenhagen is pretty utopian, Alice - t<span>he air is clean, there are bike lanes everywhere.<br/><br/></span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>That sounds fantastic, but what about somewhere like Beijing with its constant <strong>smog</strong> – or air pollution – hanging over the city? A lot of people ride bikes there too. So which city is going to be the model for the future?<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Maybe like the future Los Angeles in the movie <em>Blade Runner</em> – you know, glittering high-rises, gigantic neon billboards, flying cars…<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well, today's Los Angeles has terrible urban sprawl and traffic problems.<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong><strong>Urban sprawl</strong> is the way a city spreads into undeveloped land around it, often without planning permission.<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Dr Janice Pearlman can explain why this happens. She is the founder and president of the Megacities Project non-profit organization in Rio de Janeiro and knows a lot about urban sprawl in Brazilian cities.<br/><br/><strong>INSERT<br/> </strong><strong><span>Dr Janice Pearlman, founder and president of the Megacities Project non-profit organization, Rio de Janeiro<br/></span></strong><span>People are coming massively into the cities which have no housing that's affordable to them. So they can't rent and they can't buy, and they end up building their own communities and houses on unoccupied land. And these communities are becoming in some places the majority not the minority and they're off the grid so they're not often serviced by either the social services but also many of them don't have water, sanitation and electricity.<br/><br/></span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>People <strong>migrate</strong> – or move – from the countryside to the city to get better opportunities, but end up with nowhere to live.<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>So they build their own housing on unoccupied land. These <strong>shanty towns</strong> – poor communities where the houses are built out of cheap materials like corrugated iron and plastic sheeting – are often <strong>off the grid</strong>…<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Which means they don't have an electricity or water supply – or access to healthcare and education. And these communities are growing, so the problem is getting bigger. So are there any solutions, Alice?<br/><br/><strong>Alice</strong></p><p>Well, it's all about improving the <strong>infrastructure</strong>. That's the basic facilities a town or city needs, for example: communication, transport, water, and electricity. But this shouldn't only mean improving housing conditions, but also promoting education and employment among the inhabitants, and building better communities.<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>That sounds like a real headache for the urban planners.<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>You're right there. And one thing urban planners are talking about at the moment is creating 'smart cities'. John Rossant, founder and chairman of the non-profit organisation New Cities Foundation, explains what it is.<br/><br/><strong>INSERT<br/> </strong><strong><span>John Rossant, founder and chairman of the non-profit organisation New Cities Foundation, New York City<br/></span></strong><span>I think, you know, generally it's accepted that cloud computing, ubiquitous internet, robust 5G networks etc, will transform our cities, whether they're in the global south or the developed world. And, you know, technology is really a game changer, I think, in urbanisation.<br/><br/></span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>John Rossant there. What's <strong>ubiquitous</strong>, Alice?<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>It means available everywhere. So, the idea behind smart cities is to use technology to collect large amounts of data about how a city is performing.<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And that will be a <strong>game changer</strong> – significantly affecting the way our cities function.Hope for the future, Alice?<strong><br/><br/></strong><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Fingers crossed. Now, I think it's time for the answer to today's quiz question, Neil. I asked: What is the percentage of the world's population that will be living in cities in 2050? And remember I said we are dealing with approximates here? Is it…  a) 10%? b) 50%? Or c) 70%?<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I said a) 10%.<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Yes, and you underestimated there, Neil. The right answer is actually c) 70%. This, according to a report by the United Nations. Today 54% of the world’s population lives in urban areas.<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>A lot really!<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Yeah.<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, I know we're running out of time, so let me repeat the words we learned today. They were:<br/>congested<br/>utopia<br/>smog<br/>urban sprawl<br/>migrate<br/>shanty towns<br/>off the grid<br/>infrastructure<br/>ubiquitous<br/>game changer<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well, that's the end of this edition of 6 Minute English.

I'm Alice…</p><p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>… And I'm Neil. Can you pass me my drink, Alice?</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Cola, Neil? That's very unhealthy.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>You told me to stop drinking coffee because it's unhealthy – now you're telling me cola is bad too.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Cola is full of sugar. There are about six teaspoons in each can.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>At least. That's pretty sugary, I admit!</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well, we're talking about diabetes today. <strong>Diabetes</strong> is a condition where the body can't control the amount of <strong>glucose</strong> – or sugar – in the blood. If left untreated, diabetes can cause many complications, including heart attack, stroke, kidney failure, and blindness.<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I'm not diabetic, though, Alice, so what's the problem?</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well, diabetes is <strong>on the rise</strong> – or increasing – all over the world. And particularly type 2 diabetes where risk factors include <strong>obesity</strong> – or being very overweight – unhealthy diet and lack of physical exercise.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I see. Well, while I think about that, maybe you could ask me today's quiz question.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>OK. Can you tell me how many people in the world suffer from diabetes? Is it…<br/>a) 4.15 million?<br/>b) 41.5 million?<br/>Or c) 415 million?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I'll take a guess and say b) 41.5 million.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well, we'll find out if you got the right answer later on, Neil. Now, why do you think people are eating less healthily than they used to?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, processed food has become very popular, and whilst it often tastes really good, it isn't always a healthy choice.  </p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Do you eat a lot of processed food, Neil?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Of course not, Alice! <strong>Processed</strong> <strong>food</strong>, by the way, is food that's been changed from its natural state, for example, by freezing or re-hydrating it, or by adding ingredients to it such as sugar, salt or fat. But let's move on now and talk about exercise.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>OK – but I hope you aren't planning to have fried chicken again for lunch today from that dodgy fast-food joint round the corner. Now, one reason that people are taking less exercise than they used to is because of lifestyle changes. With increasing urbanisation people are no longer doing jobs that involve as much physical activity.  </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, it's true. And <strong>urbanisation</strong> means the growth of towns and cities as people move there from the countryside to live and work. We're all sitting in cars, and offices, or on our sofas in front of the TV.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>But it's also true that children are less active than they used to be. I remember running around all the time outdoors when I was a kid. Nowadays, they're all in front of screens, playing computer games or watching videos on YouTube.  </p><p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>So, adults and children are at higher risk of developing diabetes if they are overweight because they are likely to have higher levels of sugar in their blood. Let's hear more about this from Dr Etienne Krug from the World Health Organization.</p><p><strong>INSERT<br/> </strong><strong>Dr Etienne Krug, Director of the World Health Organization<br/></strong>Diabetes is a kind of continuum. Gradually the levels of sugar in the blood increase until reaching the level of being diagnosed with diabetes. But people, before reaching diabetes, have too high level of sugar as well, sometimes, and that can be dangerous too – particularly causing cardiovascular diseases, which contributes to mortality too.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>What's a <strong>continuum</strong>, Alice?</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>It's something that changes slowly over time. So in this case, as people increasingly eat food that's high in sugar and fat, the amount of sugar in their blood increases.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And having a high blood-sugar level may reach a <strong>tipping point </strong>– or a point when small changes become significant enough to cause a big change – and you develop diabetes. But even if you don't develop diabetes, high blood sugar can be damaging to your health.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>It isn't only damaging to the individual, though. Diabetes has a huge cost to society – $827bn is currently being spent every year to treat the disease.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>That's big bucks! What can we do – what can governments do – to tackle this health crisis, Alice?</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well, a key approach is to tackle the global rise in obesity because this addresses not only diabetes but other diseases, too, such as cancer and cardiovascular disease. Let's hear more from Dr Krug about ways to do this.</p><p><strong>INSERT<br/> </strong><strong>Dr Etienne Krug, Director of the World Health Organization<br/></strong>We need a combination of approaches to promote physical activity and to improve the ways we eat and that goes from breast feeding or even working with young kids to increase healthy eating. But the sugar tax is a good example that has contributed in Mexico to a decrease in sales of sugary drinks. And sugary drinks – just one drink can sometimes represent more sugar than a person needs for the whole day.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Government schemes to encourage healthy eating sound like a good plan, but trying to get kids to eat vegetables might be tough!</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Or stop you from drinking sugary drinks, Neil, for that matter.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Leave me alone!</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Alright, then. But the government tax on sugary drinks has worked in Mexico – and the UK government is also planning to do this. OK – now remember I asked you, Neil: How many people in the world suffer from diabetes? Is it… a) 4.15 million? b) 41.5 million? Or c) 415 million?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I said 41.5 million.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Sorry, that's the wrong answer, Neil.<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Of course it's the wrong answer!<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Yes, I'm afraid so. According to the Diabetes International Federation, based in Belgium, as of 2015, an estimated 415 million people have diabetes worldwide. This represents 8.3% of the adult population, with equal rates in both women and men.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>OK, I'll be drinking herbal tea from now on. Let's listen to the words we learned today. They were:<br/>diabetes<br/>glucose<br/>on the rise<br/>obesity<br/>processed food<br/>urbanisation<br/>continuum<br/>tipping point</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

I'm Alice…</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>…and I'm Rob.</p><p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>So Rob, did you get that research done that I asked you to do over the weekend?</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>Oh … It was at the top of my to-do list. But Sunday night came around so quickly, and I just – you know – I didn't get round to it.</p><p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>Rob! If I'd known you weren't going to do the research, I'd have done it myself. What did you actually do at the weekend, anyway?</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>Oh, you know, this and that. It's funny how time slips by without you noticing.</p><p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>Hmm, yes. I bet you spent the whole weekend watching cat videos on YouTube – and googling your own name.</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>What? That's unfair and untrue, Alice – well, mostly untrue, anyway – I did some shopping and I fixed my bike as well as watching videos and googling myself.</p><p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>Well, perhaps I should say at this point that today's show is about <strong>procrastination</strong>, which means not doing something you're supposed to do.</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>Well, I do feel bad about my procrastination actually.</p><p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>Well, that's good to hear. But let's move on now and hear today's quiz question: Can you tell me which American said: 'You may delay, but time will not?' Was it…</p><p>a) John F Kennedy?<br/>b) Benjamin Franklin?<br/>Or c) Franklin Roosevelt?</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>OK. I think I'll go for a) John F Kennedy because I reckon he was good at making to-do lists and then getting on with them.</p><p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>Unlike somebody I could mention.</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>Alice, I thought we were going to move on?</p><p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>Alright then.</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>Personally, I think it's important to try and understand why we procrastinate. So let's hear from Daphna Oyserman, Professor of Psychology, Communication and Education at the University of Southern California, talking about this.</p><p><strong>INSERT</strong><br/><strong>Daphna Oyserman, Professor of Psychology, Communication and Education at the University of Southern California</strong><br/>People spend most of their time focussed on the present, which makes perfect sense because the present is now, and for sure. Unfortunately, many things that are quite important about the future require that we start doing things now rather than waiting for later to happen. Things like saving for retirement, studying for college entry exams, revising papers, preparing for work reports. Unfortunately, waiting till later means that we won't have much time.</p><p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>So, we are too focussed on the present, and reluctant to engage in tasks that relate to the future. Why's that, Rob?</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>Well, like Professor Oyserman says, things in the future may never happen – or seem too far off for you to take seriously. For example, when you're young, sorting out a pension plan doesn't feel like a <strong>priority</strong> – or something that's more important than other things.</p><p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>But according to a new study, if you think about time in smaller units – so days, for example, rather than months or years – you are likely to start a task more quickly.</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>So, this weekend I wasted two days…</p><p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>Or 2,880 minutes.</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>That does sound more urgent, when you put it like that.</p><p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>Yes. And you need to <strong>minimize</strong> – or reduce – distractions. Turn off your tech and knuckle down to your tasks, Rob.</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/><strong>To knuckle down</strong>, by the way, means to start working hard. But Alice, sometimes it's hard to knuckle down to a task when you don't know how to start it – or you're scared to start it – or sometimes just because you know it's going to be really<strong> tedious</strong> – and that means boring.</p><p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>Yes. So what's your excuse, Rob?</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>Well, it's boredom, usually.</p><p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>You should try temptation bundling.</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>Temptation bundling - what's that?</p><p><strong>Alice</strong><br/><strong>Temptation bundling</strong> means doing two activities together – one you should do but are avoiding, and one you love doing which isn't productive.</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>For example, eating biscuits while I work?</p><p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>Yes, that's right. That sounds like a good one for you, Rob.</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>It might be a good idea actually. Well, let's listen to Dr Catherine Loveday talking about how we often underestimate how long things will take us.</p><p><strong>INSERT</strong><br/><strong>Dr Catherine Loveday, Westminster University<br/></strong>There's this thing called the planning fallacy. My favourite one is always the example of the Oxford English Dictionary that they started in 1857 and it was supposed to take five years, but five years later they'd only got to the word 'ant'. In the end it took another 70 years and then it was out of date and they had to start again anyway. We never seem to get any better at judging time in the future and how long things will take us.</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>That's Dr Catherine Loveday. So what's a <strong>fallacy</strong>, Alice?</p><p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>It's a mistaken belief or idea.</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>And for the famous Oxford English Dictionary – their mistake was to think they would get the work done in five years when it actually took 70!</p><p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>Gosh! Wow! What a long time! And talking about time – ours is running out – let's go back to today's question. I asked: Which American said, ""You may delay, but time will not?"" Was it … a) John F Kennedy, b) Benjamin Franklin or c) Franklin Roosevelt?</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>And I very confidently said John F Kennedy.</p><p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>Yes, you did. And you were wrong today Rob, I'm afraid. It was Benjamin Franklin, one of the Founding Fathers of the United States. Franklin was a leading author, printer, political theorist, politician, freemason, postmaster, scientist, inventor, civic activist, statesman, and diplomat. I doubt he wasted much waste time procrastinating!</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>No. OK, without further delay, here are the words we learned today:<br/>procrastination<br/>priority<br/>minimize<br/>knuckle down<br/>tedious<br/>temptation bundling<br/>fallacy</p><p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

I'm Alice…</p><p><span> </span><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>… And I'm Neil.</p><p><span> </span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Can you do any impersonations, Neil?</p><p><span> </span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>How about this one: My name is Michael Caine. Not a lot of people know that.</p><p><span> </span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Michael Caine, one of our best loved actors here in Britain. Not bad, Neil. And is a very good way to start today's show. We are talking about <strong>impersonation</strong> – or the act of pretending to be somebody else. Why do we like impersonations, Neil?</p><p><span> </span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, sometimes the impersonator is a comedian and doing it to be funny. But another reason is that we get the opportunity to meet people who are no longer with us – like Elvis Presley or Marilyn Monroe. Either way, it helps if it's a good impersonation.</p><p><span> </span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Yes, some impersonations are pretty <strong>cheesy</strong> – and that means bad quality.</p><p><span> </span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Oh yeah so… uh-huh… OK, Alice, I have a question for you!</p><p><span> </span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Neil, that's terrible!</p><p><span> </span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Elvis, please, come on. Can you tell me the name of a musical act that impersonates a famous group? Is it …<br/>a) tribute, <br/>b) tribune,<br/>or c) tribunal?</p><p><span> </span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>I'll go for a) tribute.</p><p><span> </span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>A tribute act? OK, well, we'll find out if you got that right later on in the show. But, Alice, don't you think some impersonators start to believe they really are the personalities they imitate?</p><p><span> </span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>What makes you say that?</p><p><span> </span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Just think: every time you appear as Elvis Presley, you get fans yelling, 'Elvis, Elvis, we love you, Elvis!' And after a while that boundary between you and the real Elvis starts to blur. It must be quite tempting to, you know, pretend that you're the king of rock'n'roll…</p><p><span> </span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>I'm not convinced, Neil. I think Elvis hangs up his wig and moves on. So let's move on too, and talk about the art of imitation. Here's British impressionist Jon Culshaw providing some tips on how to <strong>imitate</strong> – or copy – people.</p><p><span> </span><strong>INSERT<br/> Jon Culshaw, impressionist<br/></strong>Don't just say the catchphrase, don't just say, 'I am Michael Caine.' Say a bit more, get some gags going, some conversation going. Notice the things which are worth stretching, which are worth exaggerating to really give you the caricature of that person. It might be a little tic, it might be a little nuance - whatever you notice first really.</p><p><span> </span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Jon Culshaw, there. What's a <strong>catchphrase</strong>, Neil?</p><p><span> </span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>It's a well-known phrase, often associated with a famous person – like the one I used for Michael Caine earlier on! 'Not a lot of people know that.' So Jon is saying that it isn't enough to repeat a catchphrase or use another impersonator's ideas – you need to think of your own <strong>gags</strong> – or jokes.</p><p><span> </span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>And you do this by noticing and then exaggerating a person's tics. A <strong>tic</strong> is something you do often without realizing you're doing it, like using certain phrases or gestures – for example, scratching your head. Or in your case, Neil, wiggling your eyebrows.</p><p><span> </span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Do I wiggle my eyebrows?</p><p><span> </span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>You're doing it right now! But moving on, there is a serious and very negative side to impersonation. Some <strong>impostors</strong> – or people who deceive others by pretending to be somebody else – pose as doctors or lawyers, for example.</p><p><span> </span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>You mean without having the qualifications to do the job?</p><p><span> </span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Exactly – which can have serious consequences, for example pretending to be a doctor with no medical knowledge.</p><p><span> </span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Like in the film with Leonardo DiCaprio where his character impersonates an airline pilot, a doctor, and a lawyer.</p><p><span> </span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>DiCaprio's character in the movie Catch Me If You Can is actually based on a real man called Frank Abagnale. Pan Am estimated that in two years Abagnale flew 250 flights to 26 countries.</p><p><span> </span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>OK, let's listen to Dr Naftali G. Berrill, a forensic psychologist in New York City. He evaluates people for the American government. Here he's talking about another real case of a woman in the US who was caught pretending to be an attorney – that's a lawyer.</p><p><span> </span><strong>INSERT<br/> </strong><strong>Dr Naftali G. Berrill, forensic psychologist in New York City<br/></strong>The thing that was most troubling is that because she realized that she was not an attorney and that she was taking people's money under false pretence, there was no sense of remorse or sense of sadness that she had exploited the people that trusted her. But, you know, in cases where you get these impostors who specifically are pursuing financial gain, they know what they're doing, but they do it with the shallow conscience of an antisocial personality.</p><p><span> </span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>That was Dr Naftali G. Berrill. What does <strong>remorse</strong> mean, Neil?</p><p><span> </span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>It means being sorry for something you've done.</p><p><span> </span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>And our <strong>conscience</strong> is our inner sense of right or wrong – so a <strong>shallow</strong> conscience is one that isn't very deep.</p><p><span> </span><strong>Neil<br/></strong><strong>Antisocial</strong> in this context means harmful to other people and to society – although in a general sense, it means not enjoying the company of others.</p><p><span> </span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>OK. Well, I love your company, Neil, as you know. Now, how about the answer to today's quiz question?</p><p><span> </span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I asked: What's the name we use for a band that impersonates a famous group? Is it … a) tribute? b) tribune? Or c) tribunal?</p><p><span> </span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>I said tribute.<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And you were right!<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Hurray!<br/><br/><strong>Neil</strong><br/> Many tribute acts copy the singing style and the appearance of the group as well as playing their music. They often name themselves based on the original band's name (sometimes with a pun), or on one of their songs or albums. For example, <em>Bjorn Again</em> – a famous Abba tribute band. This name is a pun on 'Bjorn', a member of Abba, and the phrase 'Born Again', which means to come back to life!<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>OK. It's time to hear the words we learned today. They are:<br/>impersonation<br/>cheesy<br/>imitate<br/>catchphrase<br/>gags<br/>tic<br/>impostors<br/>conscience<br/>shallow<br/>antisocial<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

Alice and Rob consider which study techniques are effective – and which aren't – including Rob's suggestions to sleep with his textbook under his pillow and singing in the shower., 16 Jun 2016,"<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Alice…<br/><br/><strong>Rob<br/> </strong>… And I'm Rob.<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>So, it's nearly exam time again. And the subject of today's show is how to prepare well for an exam.<br/><br/><strong>Rob<br/></strong>I've got some great tips, actually, Alice.</p><p><span> </span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Have you really? Can you remind me what grades you got at school?<br/><br/><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes, well … [mumbles] …<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>So, you didn't get very good grades.</p><p><span> </span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>I probably should've started revising earlier. But my learning strategies were very good.<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Oh, really? Well, when you <strong>revise</strong> for an exam you study information you learned before. OK, Rob, I'd love to hear more about your learning strategies, but first here's today's quiz question for you. What's the word for a system, such as use of special poems or rhymes to help you remember something? Is it …<br/>a) pneumatics<br/>b) mnemonics<br/>Or c) hypnotics?<br/><br/><strong>Rob<br/></strong>I'll go for b) mnemonics.<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well, we'll find out whether you got the answer right or not later on in the show. Now, according to current scientific research, some study methods popular with students aren't actually very effective.  </p><p><span> </span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Don't tell me – putting your textbook under your pillow at night doesn't work.</p><p><span> </span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Did you try doing that, Rob?</p><p><span> </span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes, I did, but without much success. Maybe I was using the wrong kind of pillow?!<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well, let's talk about more conventional methods than the book-under-the-pillow one. These include summarising, highlighting or underlining text to help you remember it… I do love a pack of highlighting pens, though.</p><p><span> </span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Oh yes, me too. And actually highlighting text was one of my top tips. But I used to get so absorbed with the highlighting I'm not sure I was actually learning anything useful. My notebooks were works of art, though!<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Yes, and that's the point made by John Dunlosky, Professor of Psychology at Kent State University in the US, who says that you need to do more than just highlight information. You need to test yourself on it. Let's hear from him now.<br/><br/><strong>INSERT<br/> John Dunlosky, Professor of Psychology at Kent State University in the US<br/></strong>Students who can basically test themselves or try to retrieve material from their memory are going to learn that material in the long run a lot better. So for instance maybe you start by reading a textbook using your favourite highlighter and favourite colours, but then you go back and make flashcards of all the critical concepts and instead of just rereading those, you basically try to test yourselves on them.<br/><br/><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Professor John Dunlosky there. So he says trying to memorise the material isn't enough. You need to do something with it, for example, making flashcards of <strong>critical</strong> – or important – concepts and then testing yourself on them.<strong><br/><br/></strong><strong>Alice<br/></strong>By repeatedly testing yourself on something, you strengthen the pathways between <strong>neurons</strong> – or nerve cells – in the brain. And the more often you do this, the easier it becomes to retrieve information.</p><p><span> </span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And <strong>retrieve</strong> means to get something back.</p><p><span> </span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>That's right. When you repeatedly test yourself over a longer period of time – for example, over months or weeks - this is called <strong>distributed practice</strong> – and psychologists believe this is a very effective way to learn.</p><p><span> </span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>It sounds like hard work, though, doesn't it? I prefer the <strong>cramming</strong> method – which means to try and learn lots of information in a short period of time. For example, the night before the exam.</p><p><span> </span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>I don't know, Rob. We don't cram to learn other things – like music or dancing, or football or language learning. It's far more effective to join a conversation class and practise speaking every week than to practise for hours in front of the mirror the night before your oral exam!</p><p><span> </span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>That's a good point. In fact, I used to sing irregular French verbs to myself, every day in the shower for weeks before my French exam, and that helped me remember them more easily.</p><p><span> </span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Excellent! Making different types of associations with what you're trying to learn – for example, musical associations – is meant to be effective. Let's listen now to Professor Dunlovsky talking about visual associations.</p><p><span> </span><strong>INSERT<br/> John Dunlosky, Professor of Psychology at Kent State University in the US<br/></strong>I would encourage students as they are reading to try and elaborate mentally using images, as they're reading, to kind of develop a more vivid picture of what they're reading. Again, that'll help quite a bit for some kinds of studies – maybe history and so forth – and a little bit less so for more conceptual studies.</p><p><span> </span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And if you <strong>elaborate</strong> on something, it means you add more information – in this case, mental pictures.</p><p><span> </span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>So, creating mental pictures is useful for some subjects – like history or languages. But <strong>conceptual</strong> subjects – ones based on abstract ideas rather than things – like maths, for example – it might not be so easy to associate ideas with pictures.</p><p><span> </span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Now what about Albert Einstein? People say he was a very visual thinker.</p><p><span> </span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well, you've got me there, Rob. I don't know the answer to that but I can give you the answer to today's quiz question. I asked: What's the word for a system, such as use of special poems or rhymes to help you remember something? Is it … a) pneumatics, b) mnemonics or c) hypnotics?</p><p><span> </span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>I said mnemonics.</p><p><span> </span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>And you were right!</p><p><span> </span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Great!</p><p><span> </span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well done! Research on mnemonics suggests they are a good strategy for learning certain kinds of things, like how to spell difficult words. For example, the first letters of this sentence: '<strong>b</strong>ig <strong>e</strong>lephants <strong>c</strong>ause <strong>a</strong>ccidents <strong>u</strong>nder <strong>s</strong>mall <strong>e</strong>lephants' spells 'because'. Now, do you think you can remember the words we heard today, Rob?</p><p><span> </span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>We heard:<br/>revise<br/>critical<br/>neurons<br/>retrieve<br/>distributed practice<br/>cramming<br/>elaborate<br/>conceptual</p><p><span> </span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

Alice and Rob discuss whether grey hair is best when it comes to making money., 09 Jun 2016,"<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript.<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Alice…</p><p><strong>Rob<br/> </strong>… And I'm Rob.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>So Rob, did you have a part time job while you were at university?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes, I worked in the student bar.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Did you learn anything from the experience?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>I learned how to pull a decent pint.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Did you learn anything else?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes, I learned how to add up.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Didn't they teach you that at school?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>I wasn't good at doing sums in my head – you know – mental arithmetic. But I got pretty good at it as a barman. They didn't have computerized cash registers in my day, you see.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>I didn't realize you were <em>that</em> old, Rob! Anyway, the subject of today's show is young business entrepreneurs. So, can you answer this question: How young were the founders of Facebook and Microsoft when they first set up their companies? Were they…<br/>a) junior high-school students<br/>b) high-school students<br/>Or c) university students?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And Alice in case you think I don't know, Facebook is an online social networking service and Microsoft is a computer software company. OK?</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well done!</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well I'm going to say they were b) high-school students.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>We'll find out if you chose the right answer later on in the programme. But let's talk now about what <strong>drawbacks</strong> – or disadvantages – there are for young entrepreneurs. What do you think, Rob?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Hmm. Well, I suppose one of the drawbacks of being young and your own boss is that everyone who works for you is older than you!</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Is that a drawback?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well, let's consider a real case. Young British entrepreneur Suleman Sacranie started his first company when he was 17, followed by another business shortly afterwards. Then whilst studying chemistry at university he started his third company, an online version of the pound shop – or dollar store in the US – where everything in the shop is priced at one pound. Let's listen to Suleman Sacranie talking about his company.</p><p><strong>INSERT<br/> Suleman Sacranie, founder of online wholesaler 99pwholesaler.com<br/></strong>I'm actually quite fortunate now, compared to what I was six months ago because now I've got two additional directors who have grey hair. It actually… commercial meetings are excellent now, you know. But before that I think I came across quite professional but you could still tell they were thinking in the back of their heads, 'I've got a kid sitting in front of me.'<br/><br/><strong>Rob<br/></strong>So young entrepreneur Suleman Sacranie has got two grey-haired directors working with him now.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>That's right – but how does having grey-haired executives on board help, Rob?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well, '<strong>executives</strong>' are people who run a business and <strong>on board</strong> means being part of a team. Well, to answer your question, Alice, they bring experience to the table. I have a few grey hairs you know – you could learn a lot from me.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>I do, Rob. Everyday. And if you<strong> bring something to the table </strong>it means you provide something useful. Well, what do you bring to the table, Rob?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well, bad jokes, peanuts, crisps, cups of coffee, that sort of thing…</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>I was going to say a <strong>keen</strong> mind, in other words, a well-developed mind, and… great business acumen!</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Come on, you weren't going to say that!</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>You're right, I wasn't. <strong>Acumen</strong> means good judgement. But don't worry, you have an abundant enthusiasm that makes up for it. But moving on now, do you think that school prepared you well for working life?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>No, not really. I studied Latin at school, and I don't use that much. And maths – well, I never use trigonometry or calculus. So I'm not sure how useful maths lessons were…</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Yes, and you only learned to add up in the university bar after all…</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes, but I am very good at it! And the point is that I've got a fantastic job now. And if you're really interested in something you can always <strong>acquire</strong> – or get – the skills you don't have. Let's listen to successful young entrepreneur Jessica Rose talking about her experience. She works with jewellery.</p><p><strong>INSERT<br/> Jessica Rose, owner of a jewellery making business<br/></strong>I didn't need all these previous skills and experience to go out there and start on my own. When I first started I had no business training whatsoever, no jewellery training whatsoever, but I kind of woke up one day and thought I'd really love to be a jewellery designer. Which is kind of a tricky position to be in, because it's you know, a lot of people would say and did say, well, you know, you're mad.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>So Jessica Rose used her savings to learn jewellery making and then set up her own jewellery-making business.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And despite setting out with no business experience and no jewellery training – her enthusiasm for the article <strong>paid off</strong>.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>And that means it was successful.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>A bit like me…</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Yes. OK, I think it's time for the answer to today's quiz question. I asked: How young were the founders of Facebook and Microsoft when first set up their companies? Were they… a) junior high-school students, b) high-school students or c) university students?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>I said b) high-school students.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>And you were wrong, I'm afraid, Rob. Sorry.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Again.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Yes. Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates were both university students when they started their companies. Zuckerberg was studying at Harvard in the US when he launched Facebook in 2004. And Bill Gates took a break from Harvard to launch Microsoft in 1976, but never returned to his studies.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Both at Harvard – that's a coincidence. I wonder if the bar there was any good… Now can we hear the words we learned today?</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Yes. OK. They are:<br/>drawbacks<br/>executives<br/>on board<br/>bring something to the table<br/>keen<br/>(business) acumen<br/>acquire<br/>paid off</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Thanks, Alice.

I'm Alice…</p><p><strong>Rob<br/> </strong>And I'm Rob…</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Did I see you arriving in a huge red pick-up truck this morning?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes – it's great, isn't it?</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>It's very big… and red. But Rob, aren't you a supporter of the movement to preserve the environment?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Erm… Yes.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>A gas-guzzling car for an environmentalist, Rob? Isn't that a contradiction – aren't you being a hypocrite?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well, it's very fuel-efficient, Alice. It's quite eco-friendly actually.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>That's ridiculous and you know it. Hypocrisy is the subject of today's show, and maybe we should start by exploring the meaning of hypocrite. Can you tell me what did the Ancient Greek word ‘hypocrite' originally mean? Was it…<br/>a) actor<br/>b) politician<br/>Or c) horse?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>OK, that's easy. I think it's b) politician.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well, we'll find out whether you got the answer right or not later in the show. Now, these days the meaning has changed, and a <strong>hypocrite</strong> means somebody who says one thing and does another.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Like you telling me not to bite my nails because it's a disgusting habit… and then I see you doing it later the same day.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Hmm. Well, sometimes it's hard to be consistent. I do think nail biting is disgusting – but then when I'm a bit nervous I do it without thinking.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>We're often inconsistent in what we say or do, though, aren't we? <strong>Inconsistent</strong> means changeable.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>There is an explanation for us sometimes saying one thing and behaving in a very different way. Let's listen to Professor Clancy Martin at the University of Missouri in the US. He teaches Philosophy so he knows a thing or two about the way we think.</p><p><strong>INSERT<br/> Clancy Martin, Professor of Philosophy at the University of Missouri in Kansas City, US<br/></strong>So while you might be enormously compassionate in your role as a teacher or a parent, you might find yourself being quite harsh and direct when it comes to your role as a brother or a sister. So then you see that - now wait a second if I've got all these inconsistencies all over the place in my character can I really say that I'm a sincere and authentic individual? Or am I just kind of blowing with which ever way my relationship winds kind of incline me?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Professor Clancy Martin. So we play different roles in life and these roles may seem contradictory but they're just part of being the same person. Sometimes you're a bit harsh and direct with me, Alice, aren't you? Do you see yourself as my sister? She used to pick on me.<br/><br/><strong>Alice<br/></strong><strong>Harsh </strong>means stern and unkind. I don't mean to be unkind to you, Rob. Maybe I could try and be more <strong>compassionate</strong> towards you – it means show a bit of sympathy and concern now and then.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Offer me good words. At least promise you'll be nice to me. That you'll bring me tea and biscuits…</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>That's what politicians do. They promise they will do what people want and … often they don't. And it's a big problem for them. Let's talk about politicians and hypocrisy.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>They have to express opinions about so many things that it's easy to catch them out being hypocritical… – and then we, the public, get morally indignant about it.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Yes. To <strong>catch somebody out</strong> means to discover they have made a mistake. And <strong>morally indignant</strong> means being angry about something, according to principles of right and wrong. Let's listen to Professor Martin again talking about the difficulties of being a politician.</p><p><strong>INSERT<br/> Clancy Martin, Professor of Philosophy at the University of Missouri in Kansas City, US<br/></strong>I think in our contemporary democracy it's become obvious to most of us that the views that we expect from our politicians and the kinds of views that get our politicians elected are… may be completely incongruous with the way they lead their personal lives and what they personally believe. And this is how it can become very morally pernicious… very morally dangerous.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>OK, so we elect politicians based on their views – for example on the environment, on education, on foreign policy. But their public views may be <strong>incongruous</strong> – or not in agreement with – their personal views.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And the difference between their public and personal views can be <strong>pernicious</strong> - it means deadly or destructive.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Politicians are under scrutiny all the time – their personal lives, their public statements... Now with social media, a thoughtless comment <strong>goes viral</strong> – or spreads very quickly via the internet.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>That's true. And actually… I posted a photo of my red pick-up truck earlier.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Has it gone viral, Rob?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>No, but there is a negative comment from the local conservationists…</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Oh dear. Well, Rob, I think it's time I told you the answer to today's quiz question. I asked: What did the Ancient Greek word 'hypocrite' originally describe? Was it… a) actor, b) politician or c) horse.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And I said b) politician.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>And you were wrong, I'm afraid! <em>Hypokrites</em> was a technical term for a stage actor and was not considered an appropriate role for a public figure.

Alice and Rob discuss the challenges of going to space to do a job thousands of people are keen on., 26 May 2016,"<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript.</p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Alice…</span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span><span> </span></strong><span>… And I'm Rob. </span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>So Rob, what job did you want to do when you were little?</span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>I really wanted to be an astronaut. Be in orbit, watching the Earth from afar…</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Wow! Be <strong>in orbit</strong></span><span> - it means be in space and following the Earth's curvature. Well, the view must be nice from up there. But the reality of becoming an astronaut is pretty hard. And it's the subject of today's show! Did you know that less than 600 people have been into space so far?</span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>I'd like to have been one of them. I know I have what it takes to be a spaceman!</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Yes. There are many others like you who would like to go for this job, Rob. And that's the quiz question for you today. How many people have applied to join Nasa's 2017 astronaut class? Was it…<br/></span><span><br/></span>a) 800<br/>b) 8,000<br/><span>Or c) 18,000 people?</span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Mmmm… 8,000 sounds like a lot already so I'll go for b) 8,000 people.</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Well, we'll find out if you chose the right answer later on in the programme. So, what do you think is the biggest challenge when considering becoming an astronaut?</span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Well, I'd say <strong>claustrophobia</strong></span><span> – and that means: fear of being in a small space. That might be a problem because the space capsules are small and you're with the same people for months at a time. </span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, that's right. Well, astronauts are bound to get on each other's nerves sometimes! To <strong>get on someone's nerves</strong></span><span> means: to annoy them.</span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>But I'm a great team player… so I think I'll be OK.</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, I can confirm that. Anyway, the challenge of being an astronaut doesn't stop here. In the space capsule, astronauts have to put up with extremely difficult conditions. Like zero gravity, for example. </span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>It looks like doing somersaults in the capsule and catching bits of food in your mouth as it floats out of its packet… </span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>But<strong> zero gravity</strong> – a condition where gravity is exerting no force – can lead to wasting of the bones and muscles. Astronauts take two and a half hours of exercise per day to help prevent this. </span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>But what do astronauts have to do before they go into space to prepare themselves for weightlessness and spacewalking?</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>They can practice using a virtual reality headset and special gloves. It's like playing a computer game that looks and feels like doing a spacewalk. And they also train in a swimming pool! Let's listen to Major Tim Peake, a British astronaut, talking about the preparation he did for his mission on the International Space Station. </span></p><p><strong><span>INSERT<br/></span><span> Major Tim Peake, British astronaut with the European Space Agency<br/></span></strong><span>The way we practise spacewalk is in water. Water gives us the neutral buoyancy that we need. So we sink training modules into swimming pools and then practise the spacewalking on them. We wear very specific equipment, a pressurized spacesuit – very difficult to move in actually – it's hard to bend the fingers, it's hard to bend your arms – and it really gives you quite a difficult workout. </span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>British astronaut Tim Peake says water gives us <strong>buoyancy</strong>, which is the ability to float. Floating in space is similar to floating in water, so astronauts practise their spacewalk in swimming pools. </span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Yes. They take to the water and to the air too. Astronauts experience the feeling of weightlessness in planes. </span><span>A large plane with padded walls flies to high altitude and then goes into a <strong>nosedive</strong></span><span> – or a fast and sudden fall – which creates short periods of weightlessness. </span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Fabulous! I'd love to do that!</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>But it's not all fun and games. Don't forget that one of the main reasons for being out on the International Space Station is to conduct research. Major Tim Peake is doing scientific experiments such as how to grow plants in space, and what effect radiation and zero gravity have on this process.</span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Like that film where an astronaut gets <strong>stranded</strong></span><span> – or left behind – on Mars and has to grow potatoes. </span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Yes.</span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>The film is called The Martian.</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>That's right. Yes. So do you think you have what it takes to survive in a challenging environment, Rob? Let's listen to Major Tim Peake talking about his </span><span>survival training.</span></p><p><strong><span>INSERT<br/></span><span> Major Tim Peak, British astronaut with the European Space Agency<br/></span></strong><span>Survival training: for this year the European Space Agency sends us to Sardinia. When you land in the Soyuz capsule sometimes you might not land exactly where you expect to be. Foraging for food, for example, and your basic elements of shelter and protection, getting water… Go and live in a cave for seven days with an international crew. And it's a wonderful environment to prepare you for a mission because you are very isolated.</span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>So astronauts may get stranded on Earth – when the space capsule lands somewhere unexpected. And they have to find food. <strong>Forage</strong> means to search. </span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>It's a word we often use to describe how animals search for food.</span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Indeed. Well, let's go back to that quiz question you asked me earlier, Alice. I'm keen to know how many people want to live this experience of being an astronaut.</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>OK. Well, I asked: How many people have applied to join NASA's 2017 astronaut class? Was it… a) 800, b) 8,000 or c) 18,000 people?</span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>And I said quite a lot: b) 8,000 people.</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>And you were wrong, I'm afraid! According to Nasa's website, more than 18,300 people applied to join their 2017 astronaut class. This is almost three times the number of applications received in 2012 for the most recent astronaut class. </span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Wow! So there's no chance of me ever succeeding. </span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Oh, well, you mustn't give up, Rob. Anyway, we are running out of time so here are the words we heard today:<br/></span><span>in orbit<br/></span><span>claustrophobia<br/></span><span>get on someone's nerves<br/></span><span>zero gravity<br/></span><span>buoyancy<br/></span><span>nosedive<br/></span><span>stranded<br/></span><span>forage</span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

I'm Alice…</span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span><span> </span></strong><span>… And I'm Rob. Alice, I read in the paper recently that the substance called 'fluoride' might be bad for our health. But it's in nearly every brand of toothpaste, isn't it?</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>You shouldn't believe everything you hear, Rob. Fluoride protects our teeth against decay.</span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>But there's a theory that drug companies are using fluoride to affect our brains… and make us all dumb…</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>That's ridiculous Rob! </span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Well… I'm not sure if I believe it or not. But it is worrying me.</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Do you also worry that the moon landings never really happened?</span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>It's funny you should mention that because… yes! I wonder about this too… Apparently, in the 1960s television footage of the moon landing, the American flag is fluttering – and there's no air on the moon so the US government must've faked it!</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><strong><span>To fake</span></strong><span> <strong>something</strong></span><span> means to make something that isn't true appear to be real. I didn't realize you were so </span><strong><span>gullible</span></strong><span> Rob – and that means easily persuaded to believe something. </span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>I just like to question things. </span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Oh, I see…</span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>I have a healthy distrust of authority, Alice. And today we're talking about conspiracy theories – a <strong>conspiracy theory</strong></span><span> is a belief that some organization or group of people is responsible for a situation or event through secret planning.</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>We'll talk more about how healthy this type of distrust might be later on in the show. But now please focus your intellectual powers on today's quiz question, Rob. Around what proportion of the US population believes that the assassination of President John F Kennedy was not the result of a lone </span><span>gunman? Is it…</span></p><p><span>a) 6%?<br/></span><span>b) 16%?<br/></span><span>Or c) 60%?</span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>I'll go for b) 16%. </span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Well, we'll find out if you chose the right answer later on in the programme. But for now let's move on. Let's talk about what types of people are thought to be <strong>susceptible to</strong></span><span> – or likely to be influenced by – conspiracy theories. </span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>The stereotype is of a loner, maybe male, middle aged, sitting in front of the computer. But in actual fact this isn't true. People of all ages and from all social classes are susceptible to conspiracy theories. Lots of us worry that important things are being covered up – and a <strong>cover-up</strong></span><span> means an attempt to prevent the public from discovering information about something important.</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Let's listen now to Professor Chris French from Goldsmiths, a college within the University of London, talking more about people who believe in conspiracy theories.</span></p><p><strong><span>INSERT<br/></span><span> Chris French, Professor of Psychology at Goldsmiths, University of London<br/></span></strong><span>There are quite a few personality dimensions that seem to be related to belief in conspiracy theories and not surprisingly paranoia is one of them; also openness to new ideas – people who are willing to entertain ideas that are kind of off the beaten track. People who believe in conspiracy theories tend to believe in the paranormal.</span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>That was Professor Chris French. So he says that paranoia is a personality <strong>trait</strong></span><span> – or quality – that leads some people to believe in conspiracy theories. </span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span><strong>Paranoia</strong> is a strong and unreasonable feeling that other people don't like you or want to harm you.</span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>And ideas that are <strong>off the beaten track</strong></span><span> are those which are unusual and aren't shared by many other people. </span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Believing in the <strong>paranormal</strong> means believing in strange things that can't be explained by science, for example, ghosts.</span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Ghosts, yes. Do you believe in them, Alice?</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>No, Rob, I don't. How about you?</span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Well, maybe.</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Moving on. Most of the time believing in conspiracy theories is quite harmless and might even be good – because we shouldn't just accept everything that we're told. But there can also be serious consequences. Let's hear more from Professor French on this.</span></p><p><strong><span>INSERT<br/></span><span> Chris French, Professor of Psychology at Goldsmiths, University of London<br/></span></strong><span>Studies have shown that people are less likely to engage with the political process. People who accept medically based conspiracies are likely to avoid getting their kids vaccinated. And even terrorist acts – it's been shown that terrorist groups will actually use conspiracy theories as both a means to get new recruits and also to motivate people to carry out extreme terrorist acts.</span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>So the toothpaste thing I mentioned at the beginning of the show is a medically based conspiracy theory? </span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Yes.</span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>But more serious examples are parents choosing not to vaccinate their children against diseases because of <strong>unsubstantiated</strong></span><span> ideas that they are harmful – 'unsubstantiated' means 'not supported by evidence'.</span><span>  </span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>That's right. OK, now remember the question I asked earlier, Rob? Around what proportion of the US population believes that the assassination of President John F Kennedy wasn't the result of a lone gunman? Is it… a) 6%, b) 16% or c) 60%?</span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Well, I said b) 16%.</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>And you were wrong today, Rob, I'm afraid. The answer is actually c) 60%. And this statistic comes from a Gallup poll from 2013 that suggests a clear majority of Americans still believe others, besides the gunman Lee Harvey Oswald, were involved. </span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>That's more than I expected. But they might have a point.</span></p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>There you go again… Come on, Rob. Now let me remind everybody what words we've heard today. They are:</p><p>to fake something<br/>gullible<br/>conspiracy theory<br/>susceptible<br/>cover-up<br/>trait<br/>paranoia<br/>off the beaten track<br/>paranormal<br/>unsubstantiated</p><p><strong><span data-mce-mark=""1"">Rob<br/></span></strong><span data-mce-mark=""1"">That's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

I'm Alice…</p><p><strong>Rob<br/> </strong>And I'm Rob. Now, Alice, what did you get up to at the weekend?</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>I did some <strong>spring-cleaning</strong>, which means <span>cleaning a place very well, especially places you don't clean often</span>. So, I was tidying up my wardrobe, trying to organise things… and suddenly hundreds of shoes tumbled on my head!</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Poor Alice! But why do you have so many shoes? And why do you keep them at the top of your wardrobe? I only have three pairs.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>I like to match my shoes to my outfit – and three pairs wouldn't do the trick. Well, the subject of today's show is having too much stuff. And you're making me feel guilty, Rob. You must have too much of something.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes, plastic bags. I think they're useful, but they're getting <strong>out of hand</strong> – and that means not under control. They're taking over my kitchen!</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>You can recycle plastic bags, you know, Rob?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well, you can recycle shoes too, you know, Alice!</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Yes.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Now, usually I don't have a lot of <strong>clutter</strong> in my flat – and that means an untidy collection of objects. Clutter makes it harder to find the things you need. And it makes moving house a nightmare! All those boxes full of things you don't need…</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Good point. I have a friend who suggested the three buckets system. You sort things into three different buckets: one you label as 'to keep', one as 'to get rid of', one as 'maybe to get rid of'. <strong>Get rid of</strong>, by the way, means to remove something you don't want. It's the 'maybe' bucket that's tricky, isn't it? – You never know if you might need something in the future.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes, it would need to be a big bucket too.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Yes, it would.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well, l think we could all live better with less. OK, well, let's have today's quiz question before we talk more about decluttering our lives: So which word, Alice, means a belief that physical possessions are the most important thing in life? Is it…<br/>a) metaphysics?<br/>b) materialism?<br/>Or c) existentialism?</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>OK… I think it's b) materialism.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>OK. Well, we'll find out if you got the answer right or wrong later on in the show. Now let's listen to Bea Johnson, author of <em>Zero Waste Home</em> talking about how she and her family have adopted a <strong>minimalist</strong> – or deliberately simple – lifestyle in their California home.</p><p><strong>INSERT<br/> Bea Johnson, minimalist and author of <em>Zero Waste Home<br/></em></strong>We've really asked ourselves 'what is it that we really need?' We've asked really true questions, and evaluated every single thing that we have. There is nothing that we overlooked. I even came to one day look at my vegetable peeler for example and asked myself, 'Do I really need that vegetable peeler'?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>So one day Bea Johnson decided to <strong>evaluate</strong>, or to judge the importance of something, to see if she needed it.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>She evaluated her vegetable peeler and decided to put it in the 'get rid of' bucket!</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes, and to <strong>overlook</strong> something means not to see it. Now, I don't blame Bea at all because I don't like peeling vegetables either. And you could actually get the benefit of the vitamins and minerals by eating the skins.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Very healthy, Rob!</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>We can really live with fewer things. But some people can't help looking for the latest version of something or go for designer goods. Writer and journalist James Wallman warns us about this. He wonders how much stuff is too much.</p><p><strong>INSERT<br/> James Wallman, writer and journalist<br/></strong>This thing about need is such a dangerous term because what do you need? And I'm not anti-stuff – stuff is good. I'm anti too much stuff and I'm anti the wrong stuff. Don't go out and buy that labelled good that you think is going to make people think something more of you. That's not going to make you happy.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>James Wallman there. Now, Alice, do you buy labelled goods?</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>I'm afraid I do. And <strong>labelled</strong> goods or products are the ones with a famous brand name, like Gucci, Dior, Prada etc. But I do think James Wallman is right – buying things just because other people have them, for example, doesn't make us happy.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yeah, that's true, but as he says, not everything is the wrong stuff. For example, I'm very fond of my large schoolboy collection of superhero comics. I might not need them, but they make me happy. So what stuff makes you happy, Alice?</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Oh, well, I like my music CDs and my books – even though I've got the music on an mp3 player and I don't often pull a book out from the bookcase.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>They have <strong>sentimental value</strong>, don't they?</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Yes.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And that means the importance of something because of a personal or emotional feeling that we attach to it. Well, I sold all my music CDs online ages ago.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>That sounds like the sensible thing to do. OK, I think it's time for the answer to today's quiz question, Rob.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes, I asked you: Which word means a belief that physical possessions are the most important thing in life? Is it… a) metaphysics, b) materialism or c) existentialism?</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>I said b) materialism.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And you were right, Alice! Well done! The answer is indeed b) materialism.

They also talk about what risk to your health regular drinking may have., 05 May 2016,"<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript</p><p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Alice…</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>And I'm Rob…</p><p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>You look very pale, Rob. Are you OK?</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>Well, I was at a rather boozy wedding party last night. And I had a bit too much champagne. Do you know any good hangover cures?</p><p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>A<strong> hangover</strong> is the headache and sickness you can feel after drinking too much alcohol. And a <strong>cure</strong> is something that makes you better. Well, I'm <strong>teetotal</strong> – I don't drink alcohol. So, I'd say the best hangover cure is not to drink in the first place.</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>You don't believe in hair of the dog then?</p><p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>No, Rob, I don't. <strong>Hair of the dog</strong> is the belief that drinking more alcohol when you already have a hangover will make you feel better! And <strong>boozy</strong> means lots of alcohol.</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>I can see I'm not going to get much sympathy from you. So I'm going to take a couple of painkillers and let you tell everyone what the subject of today's show is.</p><p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>Alright then. Well, it's drinking too much, Rob. And I have a question for you. What is the name of the main process involved in producing alcohol? Is it…<br/>a) fermentation?<br/>b) hydration?<br/>Or c) purification?</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>OK, I know it has something to do with water so I'm going to go for b) hydration. It rings a bell from chemistry lessons at school.</p><p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>Well, we'll find out later on in the show whether you were listening carefully in class, Rob.</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>Well, er… no comment.</p><p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>Well, most people are aware of the links between smoking and cancer, but fewer are aware that drinking alcohol is linked to an increased risk of future health problems. The UK government is currently trying to raise awareness with their new guidelines on how much it's safe to drink. Let's hear what Dr Michael Moseley has to say about health risks.</p><p><strong>INSERT</strong><br/><strong>Dr Michael Moseley, Science journalist and TV presenter</strong><br/>Unfortunately whatever level of alcohol you are drinking it is likely to increase your risk of some forms of cancer, particularly breast cancer, but also other rarer forms of cancer like head, neck, and the throat. The rest are quite low at moderate drinking but they do rise rapidly.</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>So any drinking at all – even one small glass of wine with your evening meal – raises your risk of cancer? Is that right?</p><p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>Yes. And the health risk increases with the amount you drink.</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>But I thought wine was supposed to be good for you?</p><p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>It's a popular belief, but medical evidence doesn't seem to support this view. Let's listen to Dr Michael Moseley again on this.</p><p><strong>INSERT</strong><br/><strong>Dr Michael Moseley, Science journalist and TV presenter</strong><br/>Now there's long been this idea there is this marvellous stuff in red wine called 'resveratrol' which is said to reduce your risk of all sorts of things. Unfortunately the amount you'd have to consume would be so huge that the downsides of drinking red wine would swiftly overwhelm them.</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>And the<strong> downside</strong> of something means the disadvantages. Now Alice, what's your favourite tipple?</p><p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>Well, I don't have one Rob because I'm teetotal, remember? A <strong>tipple</strong> is another way of saying 'an alcoholic drink'. I enjoy beetroot and kale smoothies with a dash of turmeric and ground pepper.</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>Kale? Yuk, that's disgusting! Now, a smoothie is a thick drink made of fruit or vegetables blended with milk or yogurt or water. Well, I like sweet stuff… maybe a banana smoothie with some honey, but beetroot and kale sounds disgusting!</p><p><strong>Alice</strong><br/><strong>Don't knock it until you've tried it</strong>. And that means to try something before you criticize it.</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>OK, OK, but seriously. A glass of wine makes me happy and relaxed. And there are health studies that suggest being happy is good for your health.</p><p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>That's true, but eating and drinking healthily makes me happy! Now moving on, it's important to put the risk of drinking alcohol…</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>…or horrible vegetable smoothies…</p><p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>… in context. Statistically, drinking alcohol regularly represents just under 1% lifetime risk of death. But actually an hour of TV watching or eating a bacon sandwich a couple of times a week is more dangerous.</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>Well, that's what I like to hear! Though… what if I'm watching TV, enjoying a beer and a lovely bacon sandwich, does that triple my lifetime risk of death?</p><p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>Well, Rob, you better ask Professor David Spiegelhalter at the University of Cambridge that question. I was quoting him earlier about the TV watching and the bacon sandwich. He works with statistics, but this is for another programme. Now, let's get on to the serious matter of today's quiz question. I asked: What is the name of the main process involved in producing alcohol? Is it… a) fermentation, b) hydration or c) purification?</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>Well, I said b) hydration. Though you were <strong>sceptical</strong>, weren't you, Alice?</p><p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>Yes. And I was right to be sceptical, which means 'doubtful', because b) is the wrong answer I'm afraid, Rob. The main process involved in producing alcohol is <strong>fermentation</strong>, which is the process in which yeast or bacteria changes sugar into alcohol. Hydration is the process of making your body absorb water. And purification is the act of removing some harmful things from something. Actually, have this glass of water, Rob. Hydration is a good hangover cure – much better than hair of the dog.</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>Cheers, Alice!</p><p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>Now let's hear the words we learned today.</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/>They are:<br/>hangover<br/>cure<br/>teetotal<br/>hair of the dog<br/>boozy<br/>downside<br/>tipple<br/>don't knock it until you've tried it<br/>sceptical<br/>fermentation</p><p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

Neil and Alice discuss knights in shining armour and teach some related vocabulary., 28 Apr 2016,"<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Neil…</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>… And I'm Alice. My chair feels [audibly shifts about in her chair] uncomfortable today. How does yours feel?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Um… mine is fine - very comfortable, thank you.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well, it would be nice if you offered to give me your chair, Neil.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>What? No chance. Well, I would be uncomfortable then, wouldn't I?</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>You should give me your seat, Neil.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Should I? Well, now might be a good time to mention that chivalry is the subject of today's show.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong><strong>Chivalry</strong> these days means polite behaviour usually by men towards women.<br/><br/><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Though in the past it referred to a code of behaviour followed by knights in the Middle Ages. It was all about honour and courage in battle – and only later on about being polite to the ladies. Well, we aren't living in the Middle Ages any more, are we?</p><p><strong>Alice<br/> </strong>No comment. Let's go for our traditional question. I have a literary one for you today: Who wrote the novel <em>Don Quixote</em>, about a 50-year old man travelling Spain in search of knightly adventures in rusty armour and a cardboard helmet? Was it…<br/>a) Miguel de Cervantes<br/>b) Leo Tolstoy<br/>Or c) William Shakespeare?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I think - I'm going to get it right today, Alice – I'm going to say a) Miguel de Cervantes.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well, we'll find out later on in the show if you were right or not. But first, do you think chivalry is dead, Neil?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>No, not at all – these traditions are alive and kicking – in Poland at any rate. If something is <strong>alive and kicking</strong> it means it's active. The BBC reporter Adam Easton saw it with his own eyes and is going to describe it for us.</p><p><strong>INSERT<br/> Adam Easton, BBC reporter<br/></strong>Medieval knights' tournaments or battle re-enactments are popular across Europe. But there's something about dressing up as a knight that particularly appeals to people here in Poland. In the summer there's events every weekend and here in Malbork Northern Poland home to Europe's largest medieval castle there's one of the biggest of the season. There's archery, crossbow, jousting, other horse skills, and more than a hundred thousand people come to watch these tournaments.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>The BBC reporter Adam Easton. By the way, what's a <strong>re-enactment</strong>, Neil?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>It's where you perform the actions of a past event. And in Malbork in Poland they stage battle re-enactments every weekend apparently – at least in the summer months!</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Mmm… it doesn't sound like <strong>my cup of tea</strong> – and that means it doesn't sound like something I would enjoy doing – how about you, Neil?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, I'm not sure about the archery, crossbow and jousting. It all sounds like too much hard work. But I'd definitely enjoy the dressing up.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Excellent! Well,<strong> jousting</strong> is where two people fight on horseback using a <strong>lance</strong> – or long pole – to try to knock the other person off their horse, especially as part of a <strong>tournament</strong> – or sporting event. So with the dressing up, Neil – I'm curious. I can't imagine you as a knight in shining armour, to be honest…</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Come on, Alice. I'd look very appealing to any damsel in distress. A <strong>damsel in distress</strong> is a young unmarried woman in need of help.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>OK. You might make a very <strong>fetching</strong> – or attractive – knight, Neil. But you should get used to actually helping the ladies … maybe offering me your seat. I'm still sitting uncomfortably here…</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Come on, Alice, a knight needs to sit comfortably too. We've always been the ones with battles to fight!</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>But at some point in the history of chivalry – <strong>prowess</strong> – or skill – on the battlefield became combined with a set of <strong>conventions</strong> – or rules – governing other aspects of behaviour. This included a knight's moral and religious duties and how to conduct their love affairs. Professor Laura Ashe at Oxford University explains.</p><p><strong>INSERT<br/> Laura Ashe, Associate Professor in English at the University of Oxford, UK<br/></strong>The really strange thing is the idea that love should somehow make you a better knight. I mean, this is what is suddenly claimed in the late 12th century and it makes very little sense, you know, if you imagine a footballer telling his teammates that being in love makes him a better footballer.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>That was Professor Laura Ashe. And I agree with her. What has being a great footballer or a great warrior got to do with love?</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well, <strong>courtly love </strong>was a social code governing behaviour between aristocratic men and women that developed at the same time and amongst the same people as chivalry and the two became <strong>intertwined</strong> – or hard to separate – from then on.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And <strong>aristocrats</strong> are people of high social rank. OK Alice, I think it's time you told us the answer to today's quiz question.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Good idea. OK. I asked: Who wrote the novel <em>Don Quixote</em>, about a 50-year old man travelling Spain in search of knightly adventures in rusty armour and a cardboard helmet? Was it… a) Miguel de Cervantes, b) LeonTolstoy or c) William Shakespeare?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I said a) Miguel de Cervantes.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>And you were right! Well done! <em>Don Quixote</em> was written by Miguel de Cervantes and published in 1605. It's a comic novel which describes what happens to an elderly knight who, his head muddled by reading too many romances, sets out on his old horse with his companion Sancho Panza, to seek adventure.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Very interesting, Alice. Now can we hear the words we learned today?</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Sure, they are:<br/>chivalry<br/>alive and kicking<br/>re-enactment<br/>my cup of tea<br/>jousting<br/>lance<br/>tournament<br/>fetching<br/>damsel in distress<br/>prowess<br/>conventions<br/>courtly love<br/>intertwined<br/>aristocrats</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

I'm Alice…</span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span><span> </span></strong><span>And I'm Rob… Now, Alice – how old are you?</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>I'm 21, Rob – not a day older! </span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Come on, don't be coy about your age, Alice! – <strong>Coy</strong></span><span>, by the way, means not wanting to give away information about yourself.</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>I'm not being coy, Rob. I just… don't feel like telling everyone how old I am. Some people think it's rude to ask.</span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>I don't mean to be rude of course but … well, you are being coy. I'm asking because today we're talking about age and whether you can be too old for some things. What do you think?</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>I'm too old to order off children's menus in restaurants – but I still do it.</span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Anything else?</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Well, I couldn't <strong>pull an all-nighter</strong></span><span> anymore. </span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>OK. That's another way of saying stay up all night to finish something. That's what students do to get their work done. </span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>I used to be able to do it, and now I couldn't. I struggle to stay up on New Year's Eve until midnight. But let's move on to today's quiz question. What percentage of people aged over 65 surveyed in the UK described themselves as old? Is it …<br/></span><span>a) 6%?<br/></span><span>b) 16%?<br/></span><span>Or c) 60%?</span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Well, I think it's just a) 6%. People don't like to think of themselves as old.</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Well, we'll find out if you got the answer right or wrong later on in the show. First, let's explore the subject of aging more. Tell me, Rob, do you think you can be too old to take up a new hobby?</span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span><span> </span></strong><span>I might be, I mean, depends on the hobby of course. I went for a run the other day, and it nearly killed me. </span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>That just means you're unfit, Rob! Let's listen to Ernestine Shepherd who didn't think she was too old to take up an interesting new hobby. At the age of 71 she started bodybuilding and is currently listed in the Guinness Book of Records as the oldest female bodybuilder in the world. </span></p><p><strong><span>INSERT<br/></span><span> Ernestine Shepherd, bodybuilder<br/></span></strong><span>If ever there were an anti-aging pill, I would call it exercise. I enjoy working out with the people who come to the church. Sometimes they say, ""Oh, this hurts!"" But I tell people, ""Age is nothing but a number!"" I am 75 years of age. This morning I awakened at 2.30. I have a group of four other people who run with me in the mornings. We run about ten miles. Every day. </span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Wow! That was Ernestine Shepherd. What an example to us all! </span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span><strong>Work out</strong>, by the way, means taking exercise to make yourself fit. I think it's true that if we did more exercise every day, we would all look and feel much better.</span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Ernestine is all for exercise but I'm afraid I'd take some anti-aging pill if one existed. </span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>If something is advertised as being <strong>anti-aging</strong></span><span> it means it's designed to stop you looking older. </span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>And you can find hundreds of products these days that claim to have anti-aging properties. Lots of lotions and potions for women in particular! </span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Yes. That's because women feel pressurized to look younger than their age. It's an example of ageism and it isn't fair.</span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span><strong>Ageism</strong> means discrimination against people because of their age. And sometimes people can be discriminated against in the workplace for being 'too old'. Now, do you think you could be too old to take up a new job, Alice?</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>No, I don't get the concept of too old at all. My grandparents both still work and they have more enthusiasm and energy than I do. They hate being called <strong>senior citizens </strong></span><span>and</span><strong><span> old-age pensioners</span></strong><span> - or by the initials of these words, </span><span><strong>OAP</strong>. And they are right: who wants to be defined by their age?</span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>You just said: ""Don't get this concept"". And to <strong>get something</strong></span><span> means to understand it. </span><span> </span><span>So I suppose you stay the same inside – it's just the outside that changes! We have to be young at heart at least. And age is no reason for some people to stop working if they are in good health. Let's listen to Trisha Cusden who started a new business at 65 supplying beauty products for older women. Her age actually inspired her choice of work.</span></p><p><strong><span>INSERT<br/></span><span> Trisha Cusden, founder of Look Fabulous Forever<br/></span></strong><span>I've had an idea, I've seen a problem and an opportunity, and I've done something about it – And created a business which I'm very happy to say is very successful. I mean [when] I started it, it was going to be a hobby, you know, something to keep me out of trouble, give me something to do.</span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Trisha Cusden there. She started a new hobby and it turned into a successful business enterprise. Now, before we finish, I'd just like to put the case for older men. My dad, my granddad, Sean Connery, Michael Caine, Harrison Ford – they're all fantastic role models for us younger guys. </span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>And a <strong>role model</strong></span><span> is somebody people admire and want to copy.</span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Well, that brings us round to the matter of today's quiz question, Alice.</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, it does. I asked: What percentage of people aged over 65 surveyed in the UK described themselves as old in a survey? Is it … a) 6%, b) 16% or c) 60%?</span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Yep. And I said a) 6%. Was I right?</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, you were! You were right! Well done! More than 2,000 people aged between 65 and 93 were surveyed by UK market research firm YouGov. Now here are the words we learned today, Rob.</span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>They are:<br/></span><span>coy<br/></span><span>pull an all-nighter<br/></span><span>work out<br/></span><span>anti-aging<br/></span><span>ageism<br/></span><span>senior citizen<br/></span><span>old-age pensioner (or OAP)<br/></span><span>get something<br/></span><span>role model</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

I'm Sophie…</span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I'm Neil… Here's your coffee, Sophie.</span></p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>Neil – remember that staff meeting we had yesterday?  Why did you agree to having decaff coffee in the kitchen when I know you don't like it… and neither do I!</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>I know. It's just that the boss said that <strong>decaffeinated</strong> coffee – that's coffee with the caffeine removed – was a good idea, healthier, you know. And then everyone else agreed. And I… I don't know… I just felt uncomfortable disagreeing with everyone.</span></p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Well, it's interesting you should say that, Neil. Groupthink is the subject of today's show. <strong>Groupthink</strong> refers to the type of bad decisions we make when we are in a group. Decisions that are <strong>contrary to</strong> – or against – what we really think. A psychology experiment conducted in the 1950s showed that a lot of people do exactly that – they submit to the will of the group.</p><p><strong><span data-mce-mark=""1"">Neil<br/></span></strong><span data-mce-mark=""1"">But before we hear more about this, now would be a good time for today's quiz question. And I get to ask you, Sophie!</span></p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>OK. What is it?</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>In which story by Hans Christian Andersen does a young boy dare to tell the truth when everyone else goes along with an obvious lie? Is it…<br/></span><span>a) The Red Shoes<br/></span><span>b) The Snow Queen<br/></span><span>Or c) The Emperor's New Clothes</span></p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>OK… I think it's c) The Emperor's New Clothes.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, we'll find out later on in the show if that's right or not. Now, the psychologist Solomon Asch is well known for his conformity experiments from the 1950s. Can you tell us what ‘conformity' means please, Sophie?</span></p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span><strong>Conformity</strong> means behaviour that is the same as the way most other people behave. Asch's main finding was that group pressure can change a person's opinion, of even obvious facts.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And what did this Asch test involve?</span></p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>123 male participants were shown a card with a line on it, followed by another card with three lines on it. The participants were then asked to say which line matched the line on the first card in length. The right answer was plain to see, but the participants felt pressurized into saying the wrong answer.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Why would they do that?</span></p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>Because the majority of people taking part in the experiment had been told to give the wrong answer. Let's hear Professor Nick Chater's explanation. He works at the Warwick Business School here in the UK.</span></p><p><strong><span>INSERT<br/>Nick Chater, Professor at Warwick Business School, UK<br/></span></strong><span>By the time it comes to you a whole list of people have said something plainly wrong and you are either going to have to fold and say, 'well, I just agree with them' or you're going to rather uncomfortably say, 'well, I think it's <em>one</em> actually'. And most people, most of the time, tend to fold.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Professor Nick Chater. He uses the word <strong>fold</strong>, which means you give up. But, Sophie, if people are uncomfortable about supporting the wrong answer, or something they don't believe in, why do they do it?</span></p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>Because even though we feel uncomfortable <strong>going along with</strong> – or agreeing with – something we don't believe, we're even more uncomfortable about disagreeing with the group.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, I didn't realize that people were such sheep. I have a will of steel, Sophie.</span></p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>Is that right? So, your <strong>will of steel</strong> – or strong determination – somehow melted away in the staff meeting yesterday, I suppose?</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Oh well… of course… yes…</span></p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>Let's move on and consider briefly how social media encourages groupthink. </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, there's a real danger with something like, for example, the Twitter – the social networking service. Because when an opinion on Twitter starts to “trend”, it can take on a momentum of its own, and people adopt it simply because it's popular, not because they really believe it.</span></p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>And <strong>momentum</strong> means a force that keeps something going once it has started. Let's hear from journalist and author, Jon Ronson. He has an interesting opinion about this.</span></p><p><span><strong>INSERT<br/>Jon Ronson, journalist and author</strong> <br/></span><span>One of the ironies here is that on social media we all like to see ourselves as nonconformists but when we all get together in a group what we're doing is using our individual nonconformity to create a more conformist world. So if somebody steps out of line, all us nonconformists, in this frightened conformist way, tear them apart. It's like we're defining the boundaries of normality by tearing apart the people on the outside.</span></p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>Jon Ronson. Are you a <strong>nonconformist</strong> then, Neil – someone who thinks and behaves differently from other people?</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>I'm not the type that Jon Ronson is describing – one who joins up with other so-called nonconformists to bully people with different views. Now remember I asked you earlier: In which story by Hans Christian Andersen does a young boy dare to tell the truth when everyone else goes along with an obvious lie? Is it… a) The Red Shoes, b) The Snow Queen or c) The Emperor's New Clothes?</span></p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>I guessed c) The Emperor's New Clothes.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And you were right, Sophie! The Emperor's New Clothes is a story by Hans Christian Andersen about two weavers who promise an emperor a new suit of clothes that is invisible to those who are stupid or incompetent. No one dares to say that he doesn't see any suit of clothes until a child cries out, “But he isn't wearing anything at all!”</span></p><p><span><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>It's a great story – and a lesson to us all. Now can we hear the words we learned today please?</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>They are:<br/></span><span>decaffeinated<br/></span><span>groupthink<br/></span><span>contrary to<br/></span><span>conformity<br/></span><span>fold<br/></span><span>going along with<br/></span><span>will of steel<br/></span><span>momentum<br/></span><span>nonconformist</span></p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

Neil and Sophie discuss the health benefits of being able to speak two or more languages fluently. And Neil shows off his Japanese language skills!, 07 Apr 2016,"<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript</p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Sophie…</span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong><em>Watashi-wa</em> <em>Ni-ru</em>.</span></p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>What did you say?</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span><em>Watashi-wa</em> <em>Ni-ru</em>. 'I'm Neil.' It's Japanese, Sophie.</span></p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>Very good, Neil! So your Japanese language lessons are going well, then?</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>They are indeed. And did you know, Sophie, that scientists believe learning a second language can boost brainpower? <strong>Bilingualism</strong> – or speaking two languages equally well – is a form of brain training. </span></p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span><strong>Brain training</strong> is where you're learning ways to increase your memory or intelligence. That's great Neil – but you're not exactly… bilingual… are you? </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Not yet. No. </span></p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>Well, brain training is the subject of today's show. And ways to train your brain might be doing a crossword puzzle, playing chess, or studying a new language! Now I have a question for you, Neil.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>I hope my brain is up to the challenge. </span></p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>I'm sure it is. Can you tell me: How many <strong>neurons</strong> – or nerve cells – are there in the typical human brain? Is it …<br/></span><span>a) 8.6 billion<br/></span><span>b) 86 billion<br/></span><span>Or c) 860 billion</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Hmm. I'm going to say a) 8.6 billion. </span></p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>Well, we'll find out later on in the show whether you got the answer right or not. But now let's listen to neuropsychologist Dr Catherine Loveday talking about why being bilingual may protect your brain from damage if you have a stroke.</span></p><p><strong><span>INSERT<br/>Dr Catherine Loveday, neuropsychologist<br/></span></strong><span>I think the theory behind why bilingualism might be a protective factor is that [it] involves a lot of switchings – a lot of attentional changes – lots of switching. And that seems to exercise the sort of executive parts of our brain. Those parts of the brain are kind of stronger and fitter when it comes to resisting some kind of damage from the stroke.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>A <strong>stroke</strong> is a serious illness that occurs when blood flow to an area of the brain is cut off. And <strong>executive functions</strong> are the mental skills involved in doing things like problem solving and planning. </span></p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>So when a bilingual speaker <strong>switches </strong>– or changes – from one language to another – this exercises the executive parts of their brain, making it stronger and fitter. And because the brain is stronger, it's able to <strong>resist</strong> – or prevent – damage caused by a stroke. </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>But many of us aren't bilingual are we? So our brains aren't going to be protected against strokes. </span></p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>Don't worry, Neil. There are other things you can do to exercise your brain. If you're right handed, doing tasks like brushing your teeth with your left hand will stimulate your brain – or getting dressed in the dark with your eyes shut. Or simply memorizing a list of words, for example your shopping list.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Doing things with the wrong hand sounds hard. But the shopping list thing sounds easier… OK. Let's see… pizza, doughnuts, crisps, bottle of coke, chocolate cake…</span></p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>That's not a very healthy list, Neil! A good diet is also important in keeping your brain fit and healthy.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Maybe I should cut down on the chocolate cake then?</span></p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Actually, that's one thing you could leave on the list. According to research, chocolate may <strong>enhance</strong> – or improve – cognitive performance, and that is your ability to acquire and utilize knowledge. Now let's listen to Dr Loveday talking about building up our <strong>cognitive reserve</strong> – this is the idea of building up extra abilities to help protect the brain against declining memory or thinking.</p><p><strong><span data-mce-mark=""1"">INSERT<br/>Dr Catherine Loveday, neuropsychologist<br/></span></strong><span data-mce-mark=""1"">Continually just stimulating the brain – things like learning a language, learning music, just educating yourself, seems to continue to build up that cognitive reserve. So even if people take up languages or take up other things later in life it will give them a degree of protection.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span><strong>Stimulate</strong> means to make something become more active. Hmm. Not sure I'm continually stimulating my brain. What do you think, Sophie?</span></p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>With all our stimulating discussions, Neil, I'm sure we're both building up our cognitive reserve. And there are your Japanese lessons too. </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, so I am doing well as far as my cognitive reserve goes. Sophie you've put my mind at rest.</span></p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>And if you <strong>put someone's mind at rest</strong> you stop them worrying. Well, don't get too relaxed Neil – your brain needs constant stimulation, remember?</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Hmm. I think I might just lie down after the show with a box of chocolates and today's crossword… or maybe I'll memorize another shopping list… this time in Japanese.</span></p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>OK. I think it's time to hear the answer to today's quiz question. I asked: How many neurons are there in the typical human brain? Is it … a) 8.6 billion b) 86 billion or c) 860 billion?</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And I said a) 8.6 billion. </span></p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>I thought you were feeling clever today, Neil. I'm afraid that's the wrong answer. It's b) 86 billion. But do you know how scientists calculated that number?</span></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Did they have a guess, Sophie?</p><p><strong><span data-mce-mark=""1"">Sophie<br/></span></strong><span data-mce-mark=""1"">No, not exactly. Apparently, the easiest way is to count how many neurons there are in one part of the brain and then multiply that for the rest of the brain's volume. </span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, that's a lot of brain cells. OK, can we hear the words we learned today?</span></p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>They are:<br/></span><span>bilingualism<br/></span><span>brain training<br/></span><span>neurons<br/></span><span>stroke<br/></span><span>executive functions<br/></span><span>switches<br/></span><span>resist<br/></span><span>enhance<br/></span><span>cognitive reserve<br/></span><span>stimulate<br/></span><span>put someone's mind at rest</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

We're doing the show!</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yeah, I know. Hang on a minute. I just need to tweet something and… Done!</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>And the subject of today's show is social media and its impact on our daily lives.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Hmm, well, I suppose it has had quite a big impact on mine.</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>That's all too clear. Now, perhaps we can move on to today's quiz question?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Of course – I'm all ears. [sound of a smartphone] Oh, hang on, wait a second…</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>There's a word to describe what you're doing, you know. Answer me this: Which word describes a situation where you're talking to someone and they suddenly look down at their phone or answer it? Is it…</p><p>a) phobbing?<br/>b) phibbing?<br/>Or c) phubbing?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, you've got me there, Sophie! I have no idea! But I'll guess that it's c) phubbing!</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Well, we'll find out later on in the show whether you got the answer right or not. Now, let's move on and talk about phone etiquette – <strong>etiquette</strong> means rules of polite behaviour in society or among people in a certain group.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well… interrupting conversations to check your phone has become a social norm, hasn't it, Sophie?</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong><strong>Social norms</strong> are the rules of behaviour considered acceptable in a group or society. I don't agree, Neil! Let's listen to Professor Sherry Turkle of Massachusetts Institute of Technology talking about social norms amongst students.</p><p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Sherry Turkle, American clinical psychologist and professor of the social studies of Science and Technology at Massachusetts Institute of Technology<br/></strong>I interviewed hundreds of college students and what they talked about was what some of them called 'the rule of three'. And what the rule of three is which is that if you go to dinner with friends, you don't want to look down at your phone until you see that three people, let's say you're six at dinner, are looking up in the conversation. So there's a new etiquette where you don't look down unless three people are looking up kind of to keep a little conversation alive.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Professor Sherry Turkle.</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Why don't you try out the rule of three once in a while?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>There are only two of us here, Sophie - do the math! And I'm listening to you… mmm… let me just send a text message here on my phone ... hang on…</p><p>[pause]</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Neil… NEIL! I'm not going to carry on with the show unless you pay attention!</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Sorry, Sophie. Actually I was just doing that to wind you up. I wasn't really using my phone… Sorry.</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>And to <strong>wind someone up</strong> means to say or do something deliberately in order to annoy someone. Well, I do get wound up about people constantly checking their devices. Yesterday, I was in a café and two girls came in. They sat down and started chatting away – but not to each other – they were tapping away at their devices. And there was no face-to-face conversation at all!</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>But you can have moments of connection using your devices, you know?</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>If you have a<strong> connection </strong>with someone you engage emotionally.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Exactly. I was on the train this morning and there were a couple sharing a tablet. They were looking at the screen, and talking about what they saw there. It was very intimate, and they were… well… very connected. Let's hear from Ian Sinclair, British poet and filmmaker, talking about a new generation of connected humans.</p><p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Iain Sinclair, British writer, poet, and filmmaker<br/></strong>Physiologically we're changing, that almost the neck muscles are tipped over to look down. We're getting a new kind of human being. And I think – maybe I'm not getting it – but there is actually a different kind of intimacy emerging in which these instruments are very important.</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>So Iain Sinclair says our <strong>physiology</strong> is changing – our bodies, our neck muscles are changing – to make it easier to look down all the time at our devices! But it isn't only muscles that might change as a result of our techie habits – it's the way we <strong>interact</strong> – or engage with each other too. Ian Sinclair talks about a different kind of intimacy emerging – what does he mean, Neil?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Our <strong>intimacy</strong> – or closeness – with other people is somehow connected up with our devices. They've become part of us. And I expect some day devices will literally be part of us – an implant in our necks or something.</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>What a horrible thought!</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Let's have the quiz question again Sophie to take your mind off it.</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>OK. I asked: Which word describes a situation where you're talking to someone and they suddenly look down at their phone or answer it? Is it…a) phobbing? b) phibbing? Or c) phubbing?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I said c) phubbing.</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>You were right, Neil! Well done! It's a combination of' 'phone' and 'snubbing' – <strong>snub</strong> means to deliberately ignore someone you know. New words formed by putting together parts of existing words are known as blends or portmanteau words. And 'phubbing' is starting to appear in some online dictionaries. Now can we hear the words we learned today?</p><p>[Silence, as Neil is concentrated on his phone]</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Neil? OK! I'll say the words myself:<br/>etiquette<br/>wind someone up<br/>have a connection with someone<br/>physiology<br/>interact<br/>intimacy<br/>snub</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

Why are you looking at your fingers, Neil? I wasn't asking whether you literally have green fingers! Having <strong>green fingers</strong> means a natural ability for growing plants.

And <strong>communing with nature</strong> means feeling close to nature, and being a part of it.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, when I tried communing with nature my hands got all scratched – I got stung by nasty creepy-crawlies – and I got soil up my nose. I didn't enjoy it at all.</span></p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>Try wearing protective clothing next time – and maybe a nose plug too! A <strong>creepy-crawly</strong> is a small insect, by the way.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>So do you like getting your hands dirty, Sophie?</span></p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, I love it. And it turns out there might be a good reason for this. Dr Christopher Lowry from the University of Colorado conducted an experiment to test whether soil gives us a <strong>natural high</strong> – meaning to make us happy without taking drugs. He injected a bacterium commonly found in soil into mice to see what effect this would have on them. Let's hear what he said in this BBC programme.</span></p><p><span><strong>INSERT<br/>Dr Christopher Lowry, neuroscientist,</strong> <strong>University of Colorado US and Helena Merriman, presenter<br/></strong></span><span><strong>CL:</strong> Rodents like mice and rats are very good swimmers and it was found many years ago that if you treat animals with antidepressant drugs and then put the animals in just a beaker of water it would cause the animals to swim for longer periods of time.<br/></span><span><strong>HM:</strong> After injecting the mice with the bacterium Dr Lowry placed them in a cup of water.<br/></span><span><strong>CL:</strong> These mice that had been injected with bacterium swam during a 6-minute test for a longer period of time than animals that just got a placebo.</span></p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>So the bacterium had a similar effect on the mice as an antidepressant drug might. When we dig in soil we <strong>ingest</strong> – or absorb – the bacterium through our lungs or cuts in our skin. A <strong>placebo</strong>, by the way, is a substance with no physical effects that is used when testing a drug. So here one group of mice were injected with the bacterium and another group were injected with the placebo. And since the mice seemed happier when treated with soil bacteria, there's a good chance we would too.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Let's move on and hear about how gardening can be <strong>therapeutic</strong> – or used to try and treat addiction. Here's Scot Stephenson, a recovering alcoholic, who is learning to garden to help cure him.</span></p><p><strong><span>INSERT<br/>Scot Stephenson, recovering alcoholic<br/></span></strong><span>I left school early or should I say I got expelled... came here, I got my NVQ level 2 which is my first qualification and enjoyed it ever since.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>So Scot Stephenson was <strong>expelled</strong> from school – he was forced to leave – with no qualifications. But with the help of a support group he now has an<strong> NVQ</strong> – that's a National Vocational Qualification here in Britain – in gardening.  </span></p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>That's right. At a centre in the UK, recovering alcoholics have been given the opportunity to plant, grow, and even sell their produce. These addicts are literally breaking their addiction by breaking the soil.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Nicely phrased, Sophie!</span></p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>Thank you! Now, are you ready, Neil, for the answer to today's quiz question? </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>I am.</span></p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>I asked: What percentage of people in the UK said that gardening makes them happier, according to a survey conducted by the Royal Horticultural Society? Is it… a) 22%, b) 52% or c) 82%?</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>I guessed b) 52%. I'm wrong, aren't I?</span></p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>Oh, you are Neil, I'm sorry. The percentage of people who really enjoy gardening is much higher. You should have chosen option c). A survey from the Royal Horticultural Society has shown that Brits truly are a nation of gardeners with 82% saying it makes them feel happier. The results also revealed that 70% said that given the choice, they would prefer to spend their working day in the garden with just 9% opting for an office and 21% undecided.</span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, I'm with the 9% I'm afraid.

Because it isn't just children: Hollywood has recently produced a number of films based on traditional fairy tales for the adult market. Sophie and Neil talk about the seven dwarves and teach you some related vocabulary., 17 Mar 2016,"<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript</p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Sophie…</span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I'm Neil. So, Sophie I watched Snow White and the Huntsma</span><span>n on TV last night.</span></p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>Oh, you mean the modern retelling of the story Snow White<em>?</em> Did you enjoy it, Neil?</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>It was OK. But the seven dwarves were no fun. I prefer the original Disney cartoon version.</span></p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>Don't be silly, Neil. Walt Disney didn't invent the story. The movie you watched is a <strong>remake</strong>, a film that has been made again, but the fairy tale is very old.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, that may be true, but I still prefer the Disney version with funny dwarves. In the new version, even the names of the dwarves are different and, you know, serious looking.</span></p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>But this new version is for young adults – it's a different <strong>genre</strong> – or style – of film. Names like Sneezy, Dopey, Happy and Grumpy are too childish. </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Hmm. What's wrong with childish?</span></p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>It's right up your street, isn't it Neil?</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Too right. </span></p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>Anyway, fairy tales are the subject of today's show, and I have a question for you: which movie star played the role of the evil fairy in Maleficent, a 2014 film based on the fairy tale Sleeping Beauty? Was it…<br/></span><span>a) Cate Blanchett?<br/></span><span>b) Angelina Jolie?<br/></span><span>Or c) Meryl Streep?</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, I'll go for a) Cate Blanchett. She often plays evil characters. I can't forget her in the 2008 movie Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.</span></p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>Well, we'll find out if you chose the right move star later on in the programme. But to return to the idea of childish fairy stories, let's listen to Diane Purkiss, a children's author, talking about how originally fairy tales were intended for an adult audience.</span></p><p><strong><span>INSERT<br/>Diane Purkiss, children's author<br/></span></strong><span>Interestingly there has been a bit of a move towards seeing fairy tales as an adult, or at any rate a young adult – a dark sort of genre. And that's natural because actually in the past fairy tales were told by adults to adults in William Shakespeare's time. It's only in the Victorian era that they become moral children's tales and it looks like we're going back to the inception of fairy stories now with a more adult take on them.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Diane Purkiss. So these Hollywood remakes aimed at the teen market are actually returning fairy tales to an adult audience. </span></p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>That's right, Neil. And <strong>dark</strong> here means scary or frightening. The Victorians <strong>toned down</strong> this dark content – or made it less forceful. They also introduced a <strong>moral</strong> – or message about what's right and wrong – to the tales.  </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And <strong>inception</strong> means the beginning. So fairy tales began as a dark genre.</span></p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>Can you give us some examples of dark stories written by the brothers Grimm, Neil?</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well… I have a list here. Let's see. In The Frog Prince the princess doesn't kiss the frog, she throws it… she throws it against the wall! Hmm, yes.</span></p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>Hmm. I prefer the kiss version.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And in Little Red Riding Hood don't believe that version where the wolf shuts granny in a cupboard. In the real version he gobbles her up and then eats Red Riding Hood for dessert.</span></p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>Charming. And to <strong>gobble something up</strong> means to eat it very fast. OK, that's enough. Let's move on. Did you know that some of the stories – like Beauty and the Beast, Red Riding Hood, Cinderella, and Snow White go back much further than the earliest written stories – even the ones in Latin and Greek?</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>No, I didn't. To be honest, Sophie, I thought Walt Disney had written them.</span></p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>Oh Neil… well research suggests that some fairy tales date back to well before the brothers Grimm and even Shakespeare. Let's hear more from Dr Jamie Tehrani, anthropologist at Durham University in the UK.</span></p><p><strong><span>INSERT<br/>Dr Jamie Tehrani, anthropologist at Durham University<br/></span></strong><span><strong>Dr JTehrani:</strong> So these fairy tales that we've looked at – we've been able to trace back, really, thousands of years – probably sort of 4-6,000 years is the origin of many famous European folk tales, stories such as Beauty and the Beast.<br/></span><span><strong>BBC Reporter:</strong> What, 6,000 years?!<br/></span><span><strong>Dr J Tehrani:</strong> Yep, going right back to the Bronze Age. <br/></span><span><strong>BBC Reporter:</strong> Good heavens!<br/><strong>Dr J Tehrani:</strong> We've been able to trace the transmission across generations of these stories much further back than is generally recognized.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>But Sophie – if there's no written evidence of the stories from 6,000 years ago how does Dr Tehrani, who we've just heard from, know people were telling them?</span></p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>Well, dating languages isn't something I'm familiar with – I think it's a bit like looking at a few dinosaur bones and trying to reconstruct what dinosaurs looked like. But here you're trying to reconstruct stories without any actual bits. It must have been hard work for the researchers. </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Indeed. Well, I think it's time to hear the quiz question again, Sophie.</span></p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>OK, I asked: Which movie star played the role of the evil fairy in Maleficent, a film based on the fairy tale Sleeping Beauty? Was it… a) Cate Blanchett? b) Angelina Jolie? Or c) Meryl Streep?</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>I said Cate Blanchett.</span></p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>And you were wrong. Angelina Jolie played the main character in the film Maleficent. Cate Blanchett played the elf queen Galadriel in Lord of the Rings. And Meryl Streep played a blue-haired witch in the 2014 film Into the Woods.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Now, can we hear those words again?</span></p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>OK!<br/></span><span>remake<br/></span><span>genre <br/></span><span>dark<br/></span><span>toned down<br/></span><span>moral<br/></span><span>inception<br/></span><span>gobble up</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, that's the end of today's spellbinding 6 Minute English.

What does a work awayday look like these days? Neil and Sophie discuss the growing industry of corporate team building – from zombie bootcamps to horse training for executives., 10 Mar 2016,"<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript</p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Sophie…</span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I'm Neil… Sophie – did you go on the corporate awayday last week?</span></p><p><span><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Yes… you didn't miss anything. A team building guru lectured us on how to work more effectively with each other. We gave some presentations, had a few drinks after…  </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Right. OK. An <strong>awayday</strong> is a day that employees spend together away from their usual workplace. And a <strong>guru</strong> is an expert in something. So did this guru teach you anything new, Sophie?</span></p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>No… not really. </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Shame. I was hoping for some tips on how to work more effectively with my co-presenter.</span></p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>I think we work very effectively already, Neil. Now, today's show is about <strong>team building</strong> – or encouraging employees to work well together as a team by getting them to engage in different types of activities.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And apparently, some companies in the UK are offering their employees activities such as…  Hunger Games-style combat days where teams must work together to 'kill' as many of the opposing team as possible. Have you seen the Hunger Games movies, Sophie? </span></p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>Yes.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>There're also Zombie boot camps where military instructors train you on how to fight zombies – that's dead people who have come back to life. For the more <strong>cerebral</strong> – or brainy – amongst us – there are crime investigations modelled on popular TV dramas like Sherlock Holmes.</span></p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>Well, I'm not sure about the Zombie boot camp – a <strong>boot camp</strong> is a short course of hard physical training – but the Sherlock Holmes awayday sounds like fun.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>I'd definitely go for the Zombie experience. Though I'm not sure how it connects with most people's working lives. Violence, death, the living dead…</span></p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>Good point.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>So let's move on and have today's quiz question. What did Chairman Mao introduce in China in1951 as a compulsory activity for workers and was reintroduced by the government a few years ago? Was it…<br/></span><span>a) calisthenics?<br/></span><span>b) calligraphy?<br/></span><span>Or c) English language lessons? </span></p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span><strong>Calisthenics</strong>, by the way, is a type of gentle physical exercise…</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>… and <strong>calligraphy</strong>, by the way, is the art of writing by hand with a special brush.</span></p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>Well, I'm going for a) calisthenics. </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Not English language lessons, Sophie?</span></p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>No. I'll stick with callisthenics, thanks. </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>OK. Well, we'll find out later if you're right or not. Now, whilst English lessons might sound like hard work, <em>ukulele</em> lessons are apparently catching on. A ukulele is a musical instrument. Top businessmen Bill Gates and Warren Buffett both do it, and stressed-out city workers are following their lead. Here in the UK, a number of companies have been holding ukulele team building sessions. </span></p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>That sounds amazing. And is there anything about the ukulele in particular that leaves people feeling better after they've played it?</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Let's hear more about this from Lorraine Bow, who teaches people to play the instrument. But listen with attention because she spoke on the phone and the line wasn't great.</span></p><p><span><strong>INSERT<br/>Lorraine Bow, ukulele teacher <br/></strong></span><span>Well, I guess it's just the fact that you know people don't often sing in their everyday lives and it's the fact that you can play and sing – play a musical instrument – within an hour – it's quite a… you know… it's quite a fulfilling thing really. It's not competitive – it's quite easy to do and a bit less intimidating than a guitar…</span></p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>Lorraine, the ukulele teacher, also says her classes aren't competitive or <strong>intimidating</strong>… </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>… which means something that makes you feel nervous. </span></p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>Now, before we hear the answer to today's quiz question, let's hear about a company in Abu Dhabi where leadership is taught through horse training. Basically, you have to go in the yard with a horse and persuade it that you're the boss by using body language. Here's Kelly Eide, co-founder of the company, explaining why she thinks this approach works.</span></p><p><strong><span>INSERT<br/>Kelly Eide, Co-founder of True Leadership, Abu Dhabi<br/></span></strong><span>The horses don't care if your hair is purple, if you're a man or a woman, if you're old or young, if you are… what religion. So it transcends all of those cultural boundaries – it transcends age, gender, religion, tradition etc. – so that's a perfect fit. And in an organization where you really need groups of people to gel, who come from backgrounds which have no common norms, you can teach that most efficiently with a horse.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil <br/></span></strong><span>To <strong>gel</strong> with someone means to connect or get on well with someone. So you try and get the horse to do what you want using body language. And the horse feels instinctively whether or not you are a natural leader because it doesn't recognize cultural differences, hair colour and age. </span></p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>Probably easier said than done.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Indeed. Now remember I asked: What did Chairman Mao introduce in China in1951 as a compulsory activity for workers and was reintroduced by the government a few years ago?  Was it… a) calisthenics? b) calligraphy? Or c) English language lessons? </span></p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>I said a) calisthenics.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, you're right on the button! Well done there, Sophie! Calisthenics are used at schools as a warm up for physical education classes, during sports day activities, and by some companies as a way of building morale and a sense of group unity, as well as to raise energy levels and encourage good health. Now <strong>shake a leg</strong> – or in other words – get moving – and tell us the words we learned today, Sophie.</span></p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>They are:<br/></span><span>awayday<br/></span><span>guru<br/></span><span>team building<br/></span><span>cerebral<br/></span><span>bootcamp<br/></span><span>callisthenics<br/></span><span>calligraphy<br/></span><span>synchronise<br/></span><span>intimidating<br/></span><span>gel<br/></span><span>shake a leg</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, that's the end of this 6 Minute English.

The fourth rock from the Sun is one of our nearest neighbours in space and for centuries there has been debate about whether there is life on the red planet., 03 Mar 2016,"<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript</p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Sophie…</span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I'm Neil. Sophie – did you see the beautiful sky last night?</span></p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>No, I went to bed early. Why?</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>I was wondering if there was life out there.</span></p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>You mean life on other planets? That's just science fiction, Neil. </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>It isn't! People are fascinated by life on other planets for a good reason.</span></p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>You believe in little green men?</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Not necessarily… but possibly.</span></p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>Well, Mars is our closest neighbour in the solar system and the subject of today's show. And that brings me on to our usual quiz question. How long is a day on Mars? Is it about…<br/></span><span>a) 5 hours?<br/></span><span>b) 25 hours?<br/></span><span>Or c) 45 hours?</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And I think it must be c) 45 hours. Things are weird on other planets. And Mars is further from the sun than us… Mars may be our closest neighbour, but it's hardly in our backyard, is it?</span></p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>It is in astronomical terms, Neil – it's visible to <strong>the naked eye</strong> – meaning without using instruments – and it's reachable by spacecraft. Well, we’ll find out later on in the show whether you got the answer right or not. Now can you tell me Neil why people like you get excited about the possibility of life on Mars? </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, Mars is similar to the Earth in some important ways which means if life developed on our planet, why not Mars?</span></p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>That's true. Its temperature is in the right zone – not too hot and not too cold. But actually we could find Mars pretty cold – an average temperature would be around minus 63 degrees Celsius compared to Earth's 14 degrees Celsius. It's also very <strong>arid</strong> – or dry. </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And it needs to be wet for life to develop, doesn't it?</span></p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>That's right. Many scientists think that liquid water is essential for life! But there may have been water on the surface of Mars in the past. And recent research suggests that there may be water underground. Let's hear some more about this from Professor John Zarnecki, who teaches Space Science at The Open University. </span></p><p><strong><span>INSERT<br/>John Zarnecki, Professor of Space Science, The Open University<br/></span></strong><span>We are now seeing that in fact Mars probably does have water – not liquid water – that there is ice just below the surface and there's even just recently tantalizing evidence that perhaps water does flow periodically... Now, and also coupled with the fact that here on Earth we're finding that life in very primitive form exists in the most extreme environments, these are the so called 'extremophiles' that exist at the bottom of the oceans… So life is much, much tougher.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>What does <strong>tantalizing</strong> mean, Sophie?</span></p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>It means something you want that's almost, but not quite, within reach. So, scientists would love to think water flows on Mars but the evidence isn't strong enough for this to be certain. The other interesting point the professor makes is that life may exist in the very harsh Martian environment – because primitive life exists in extreme places on Earth.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/>E</span></strong><span><strong>xtremophiles</strong> are <strong>organisms</strong> – or small creatures – that live in very extreme environments and can survive conditions that would kill most other organisms. But on Mars they would be living underground because the <strong>radiation</strong> – or light and heat – from the Sun would kill any organisms living on the surface of the planet. So why doesn’t the Sun's radiation kill us then, Sophie?</span></p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>The Earth has a strong magnetic field created by its hot molten <strong>core</strong> – or centre – and this protects us from the Sun's harmful solar winds. </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And what about Mars - why doesn't it have a magnetic field?</span></p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>It used to – 4 billion years ago. It’s possible that a massive <strong>collision</strong> with an asteroid might have heated up Mars's core, disrupting the magnetic fields.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And if you <strong>disrupt</strong> a process you stop it from continuing normally. Now, to return to the subject of collisions, Sophie, I have something very interesting to tell you.</span></p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>Yes?</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>A <strong>meteorite</strong> – or a piece of rock from outer space – might've crashed into the Earth millions of years ago. That meteorite might have contained Martian life forms. So we might be descended from Martians! </span></p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>That's actually an interesting idea, Neil. But let's listen to Professor John Zarnecki talking about interplanetary life.</span></p><p><strong><span>INSERT<br/>John Zarnecki, Professor of Space Science, The Open University<br/></span></strong><span>If we do find traces of life on Mars we don't know, do we - whether it evolved independently or was it perhaps seeded from Earth. It is possible that life forms from Earth travelled to Mars and perhaps existed there – or the other way round. </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>So life on Mars may have <strong>evolved</strong> – or developed – on its own. Or it might have arrived from Earth in a lump of rock… Or the other way round! So Martians might be humans or we might be Martians! One big interplanetary happy family, Sophie!</span></p><p><span><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Well Neil, let's hope you stay happy after you hear the answer to today's quiz question. I asked: How long is a day on Mars? Is it … a) 5 hours? b) 25 hours? Or c) 45 hours?</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And I said c) 45 hours – they must have a long day over there.</span></p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>And you were … wrong! The correct answer is b) because a day on Mars is slightly longer than here on Earth – it's 25 hours. </span><span>Anyway, can we at least hear the words we learned today?</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>They are:<br/></span><span>the naked eye<br/></span><span>arid<br/></span><span>tantalizing<br/></span><span>extremophiles<br/></span><span>organisms<br/></span><span>radiation<br/></span><span>core<br/></span><span>disrupt<br/></span><span>meteorite<br/></span><span>evolved</span></p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

And Neil wonders how many errors he might have in his genetic code., 25 Feb 2016,"<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript</p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Sophie…</span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I'm Neil. I was watching the news the other day, Sophie.</span></p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>Learn anything interesting?</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, actually. UK scientists have been authorised by the government to genetically modify human embryos for research. What they can't do though is implant modified embryos into women. They talked a lot about gene editing... </span></p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>Can you explain to us what gene editing is?</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Mmm… I think this means there are these letters in a code – A-B-C something… I can't remember exactly…  </span></p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span><strong>Gene</strong> <strong>editing</strong> is the ability to <strong>manipulate</strong> – or control – DNA. And in case you didn't know, <strong>DNA</strong> is short for deoxyribonucleic acid – this is a substance in the cells of animals and plants that contains genetic information. And a <strong>gene</strong> is part of the DNA in the cell that controls the physical development and behaviour of a plant or animal and is passed on from its parents.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Phew! Thanks for the science lesson, Sophie. </span></p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>You're welcome. Now here's a question for you, Neil: Which science fiction film anticipates gene editing in a dystopian society where humans are genetically engineered? Is it…<br/></span><span>a) Robocop<br/></span><span>b) Gattaca<br/></span><span>or c) Blade Runner</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Mmm… I don't really understand the question but I'm going to say c) Blade Runner. What's dystopian?</span></p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span><strong>Dystopian</strong> means an imaginary society where people are unhappy and afraid. Well, moving on, let's listen to BBC journalist Fergus Walsh talking about how gene editing works.</span></p><p><span><strong>INSERT<br/>Fergus Walsh, BBC journalist<br/></strong></span><span>Think of gene editing as a molecular sat nav. It scans the DNA searching for the error. Then it uses molecular scissors to snip through both strands, which switches off the faulty gene. Or it can repair the code by inserting a healthy copy of the gene. These techniques raise the prospect of treating – even curing – some genetic diseases – and it's not science fiction.</span></p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>So DNA is a set of instructions for how our bodies work written using a chemical code of four letters – A, T, C, G. But sometimes the code contains mistakes. </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yes. You find spelling mistakes by <strong>scanning</strong> – or searching – through the DNA. Then you <strong>snip</strong> – or cut out – the mistake or faulty gene from the code using molecular scissors. <strong>Faulty</strong> by the way, means something that isn't working properly – like the faulty brakes on my bike.</span></p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>That sounds really dangerous, Neil!</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yeah, but I'm more worried about my faulty genes. I might have all sorts of genetic mistakes inside me.</span></p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>That wouldn't surprise me. But you've actually touched on a serious point. Latest research suggests all our bodies do contain genetic mistakes, some of which could cause disease. And as reporter Fergus Walsh said at the end of the clip, gene editing could be important for treating or even curing inherited genetic diseases. For patients with blood, immune, muscle or skin disorders it offers the possibility that their faulty cells could be removed, or changed in the lab, and then put back. </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>That sounds amazing. But is there a <strong>catch</strong>?</span></p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>And that means a problem or drawback. Yes. Some people think that if editing the genes of a human embryo is allowed for curing disease, this will lead to editing the genes of embryos for reasons other than health. Let's listen to Marcy Darnovsky, executive director of the Centre for Genetics and Society in California talking about her concerns.</span></p><p><strong><span>INSERT<br/>Marcy Darnovsky, Centre for Genetics and Society<br/></span></strong><span>It's too risky, we don't need it, there are other ways to have healthy children, and it would open the door – possibly – to a world of genetic haves and have nots. We don't need more inequality, we don't need more discrimination in the world. </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>An <strong>embryo</strong> by the way is an animal or human starting to develop inside its mother. Marcy Darnovsky is against gene editing because it may be used to create <strong>designer babies</strong> – or babies whose genes have been selected to have certain desirable characteristics.</span></p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>She says it may <strong>open the door </strong>– or make it possible – a situation where embryos are genetically <strong>enhanced</strong> – or improved – to be more intelligent or physically stronger, for example.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And this will lead to more <strong>discrimination</strong> in the world – which means treating some people less fairly than others… </span></p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>…which is something that science fiction has been predicting for many years. It's that dystopian society we were discussing earlier, Neil! Which science fiction film anticipates gene editing in a dystopian society where humans are genetically engineered? Is it… a) Robocop b) Gattaca or c) Blade Runner?</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And I said c) Blade Runner.</span></p><p><strong><span>Sophie<br/></span></strong><span>Sorry, Neil! It was b) Gattaca. This 1997 sci-fi film centres on the character Vincent Freeman, who wasn't genetically engineered, but is able to buy the genetic identity of another man in order to pursue his dream of travelling into space. The film's title uses the letters G, A, T and C, which are the four chemical codes making up DNA.<br/></span><span>Now here are today's words: <br/></span><span>gene editing<br/></span><span>manipulate<br/></span><span>DNA<br/></span><span>gene<br/></span><span>dystopian<br/></span><span>scanning<br/></span><span>snip<br/></span><span>faulty<br/></span><span>catch<br/></span><span>embryo<br/></span><span>designer babies<br/></span><span>open the door<br/></span><span>enhanced<br/></span><span>discrimination</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

I'm Neil…</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>And I'm Sophie… </p><p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>Sophie, I can't get out of my head what Mark Zuckerberg, you know, the guy who created Facebook, said recently.</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Oh, I know, he <strong>pledged</strong> – or made a serious promise – to give away 99% of his shares in Facebook over the course of his lifetime. The shares are currently worth around $45bn.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Why, oh why did he decide to give his fortune away? It's puzzling to me.</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>It's an act of <strong>philanthropy</strong> – which means helping others, especially by giving large amounts of money to good causes.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And philanthropy is the subject of this show.</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>But don't worry about Zuckerberg, it's probably fair to say that he will remain extremely <strong>well off</strong> – or wealthy – even after giving away his fortune.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, that's true. Let me ask you then today's quiz question: Who was the most generous philanthropist in the US last year? Was it…<br/>a) Bill Gates<br/>b) Mark Zuckerberg<br/>Or c) Warren Buffett</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>I'm going to say… c) Warren Buffett.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, we'll find out if you were right or not later on in the show. Now, Zuckerberg was inspired to give away his fortune by the birth of his daughter Max. In a letter to Max – posted on Facebook. In his post, he talks about using the money to advance <strong>human potential </strong>and promote <strong>equality</strong> for all children in the next generation. Equality – in other words, with the same rights and opportunities.</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Zuckerberg is the latest in a long line of billionaire entrepreneurs to turn philanthropist and use his money for good causes. Did you know that some of the earliest American philanthropists were robber barons?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Robber barons? What's … ? Hang on, what're robber barons?</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>They're business people who use <strong>unethical -</strong> or morally wrong - business tactics to gain large personal fortunes. Nineteenth-century entrepreneurs like Rockefeller, Carnegie and Ford were robber barons. They built up huge empires in industry – oil, steel, railways, and cars – and were largely responsible for transforming the United States from an agricultural nation into an industrial one.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Henry Ford – he's the one who said you can have any colour you want as long as it's black. I like that kind of thing.</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Focus, Neil!</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>OK. OK.</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>But as the barons got older, they decided they wanted to give back to society, and turned to philanthropy. Andrew Carnegie believed that wealth should be spent to make the world a better place.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>That sounds too warm and fuzzy for a <strong>ruthless</strong> – or cruel - robber baron.</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>People change, Neil! When he died, Carnegie had given away a total of $350m to the state to spend on public works. That's around $8bn in today's money.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, let's listen to Hugh Cunningham, a Professor of History at the University of Kent here, in the UK. He talks about what the <strong>average Joe</strong> – that's you and me, folks – thinks about big business and philanthropy today.</p><p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Hugh Cunningham, Emeritus Professor of History at the University of Kent<br/></strong>The very word philanthropy does not necessarily have 100% positive connotations for the public at large given where we are in terms of the public's attitude towards business or the banks and that kind of stuff. So I think it's in everyone's interests to try and broaden out the concept of philanthropy into a wider notion of giving, making a contribution, making a difference.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, banks and big businesses can easily afford to give away millions of dollars for the public good if they choose to. It is not so easy when you're an individual struggling to pay the rent.</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>That's right, Neil. But a lot of people in the UK are super-rich compared to those in the developing world. And we can make a big difference by <strong>donating</strong> – or giving – smaller amounts of money to help improve their lives.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And that's what Professor Cunningham means when he says we should broaden out the <strong>notion</strong> – or idea – of philanthropy. It's not only robber barons who can afford to be philanthropic. Let's listen to Toby Ord, a graduate student from Oxford University talking about how he makes a difference.</p><p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Toby Ord, moral philosopher, Oxford University<br/></strong>I worked out that over my life I'd be able to earn about £1.5m and that I could maintain my current standard of living as a graduate student and still donate about £1m of that.</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>So Toby actually gives away any money that he earns above £18,000 a year. He feels that he doesn't need more than this amount to maintain his standard of living.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I'm impressed by Toby's pledge but I don't think I could live like a student my whole life!</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>I thought that would suit you extremely well, Neil! Now why don't you give us the answer to today's quiz question?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I asked: Who was the most generous philanthropist in the US last year? Was it… a) Bill Gates? b) Mark Zuckerberg? Or c) Warren Buffett?</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>I said Warren Buffett.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Good guess, Sophie! Well done! Buffett, who made his $73bn fortune from investments, donated $2.8bn to charity in 2014 bringing his lifetime total to almost $23bn, according to Forbes. That's <strong>a tidy sum</strong> – and that means a large number! OK let's hear those words again, Sophie.</p><p><strong>Sophie<br/></strong>Here they are:<br/>pledged<br/>philanthropy<br/>well off<br/>human potential<br/>equality<br/>unethical<br/>ruthless<br/>average Joe<br/>donating<br/>a tidy sum</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

I'm Alice…</span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>… and I'm Neil. Alice, have you got two pounds? I forgot my wallet and I need a coffee. I've only got these pennies.</span></p><p><span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Sorry – I always use my bankcard in the cafeteria. </span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>You use a card to buy coffee?</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Yes. It's a tap-and-go card so it's quick – you don't enter a PIN number – and everyone in the coffee queue uses them… except you. And today's show is about how we pay for things.</span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, I pay for things with money! </span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>There are different kinds of money. You're behind the curve, digging around in your pockets for change, Neil. Do you still use cheques too?</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, I do. Cheques are very useful. Now, being <strong>behind the curve</strong> means not keeping up with current trends. So help me keep up, Alice. What's a tap-and-go card? I thought you were talking about your regular bankcard.</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Well,<strong> tap-and-go </strong>cards are regular bankcards but with a built-in chip and antenna. The card reader sends out a radio frequency and when you bring the card close to the reader, the antenna picks up the signal to make the payment.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Hmm. This antenna business doesn't sound secure – an <strong>antenna</strong> is used for sending or receiving radio signals. Doesn't it mean your personal data is flying around in the ether for anyone to steal?</span><strong><span data-mce-mark=""1"">Alice</span></strong></p><p><span>In this context, <strong>ether</strong> means the air where electronic communication happens. And nothing's flying around, Peter Pan! At less than half a second per transaction, there's no time for anyone to steal your cash! Now, why don't you answer today's quiz question? Which man's face appears on a UK ten pound note? Is it…<br/></span><span>a)   Charles Darwin<br/></span><span>b)   Isaac Newton<br/></span><span>or c)   Albert Einstein<br/><br/></span><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>None of them – it's the Queen.<br/><br/></span><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>No, Neil. The Queen is on one side, but on the other side of each note is an important historical figure.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Oh really? I've never noticed… OK, I'll go for b) Isaac Newton. He's a historical figure.</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>So are Darwin and Einstein. And coins and banknotes will be historical soon. But we'll find out if you're right later on. </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>I'm still concerned about tap-and-go. What if someone steals my card?</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Each contactless payment is limited to a certain amount – the UK's limit is £30. After you've used your card a few times in a row, you have to enter your PIN. And if a thief does go on a spending spree with your card, your bank covers you against fraud. Whereas, if someone steals your banknotes, that's your bad luck!</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>OK, good points. <strong>Fraud</strong> means getting money by cheating people. And a <strong>spending spree</strong> is a short period of time where you do a lot of shopping. Are you a big spender, Alice?</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Not with my tap-and-go, Neil. How about you and your chequebook?</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>No comment. </span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Moving on. If getting your bankcard out seems like too much trouble there's now a solution with <strong>wearable tech</strong> – that's clothing and accessories that include computer and electronic technologies. Let's hear what Kenneth Cukier, a technology expert, has to say.</span></p><p><span><strong>INSERT<br/>Kenneth Cukier, economist and technology expert<br/></strong></span><span>You can simply take any wireless card and the chip from it that your bank might issue you with, and you can put it into the coat and then when you want to make a payment you just simply wave your arm in front of the terminal and leave with your latte. This is intended for people who are incredibly lazy who don't want to take their card out of their wallet, or use their phone, or use their watch. People are going to be making more purchases more of the time – particularly for small-valued goods.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>What Kenneth Cukier said is very interesting. That sounds tempting but I'm still concerned about how safe this all is. What if I wave my arm around and make a payment by mistake?</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>The chip has to get very close to the card reader to make a payment so that's not likely to happen. Now companies are creating new biometric technology – which you might like Neil – because it combines payment and security technology. Let's hear more from the BBC reporter Kate Russell.</span></p><p><strong><span>INSERT<br/></span></strong><strong><span>Kate Russell, BBC reporter</span></strong><br/><span>For those times when not even carrying a phone is convenient – at the beach or a festival for example – the fingo-pay system reads the unique maps of veins under the surface of your finger. The trick is remembering which finger you registered with.</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>This high-tech stuff reporter Kate Russell is talking about is amazing!

I'm Alice…</span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I'm Neil… Um… Alice. What's this?</span></p><p><span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>It's a cup of tea, Neil. Would you like some?</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Oh, I can't drink that! You didn’t let the tea brew for long enough. And you forgot to add sugar.</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Well, make it yourself next time! And when you <strong>brew</strong> a cup of tea, by the way, you add boiling water to tea leaves or a teabag and allow the flavour to develop. </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>I'm sorry, Alice. I didn’t mean to be rude about your tea. But I do like it very strong and sweet.</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Tea is the subject of today's show. And Neil, I think you'd like the way they serve tea in India. They drink <em>chai </em>– a strong black tea served with lots of milk, sugar and spices. </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Mmm… that does sound good. I quite fancy a cup of <em>chai</em> now. </span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Did you know that it was the British who introduced tea to India?</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>No, I didn't, Alice. This is very interesting… I'm proud of our habit of having tea all the time and teabags are great! A marvellous little invention!</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, I agree. Well, that's my question for you today. Where was the teabag invented? Was it in …<br/></span><span>a) China<br/></span><span>b) the US<br/></span><span>Or c) Britain</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Hmm. I buy a lot of teabags but I don't know their history. So I'm going to guess c) Britain. </span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Well, we'll find out if you chose the right answer later on. Let's listen now to Professor Markman Ellis talking about the Chinese tea plant. He's a historian at Queen Mary, University of London.</span></p><p><span><strong>INSERT<br/>Professor Markman Ellis, historian, Queen Mary, University of London<br/></strong></span><span>Tea is a shrub that grows naturally in the mountainous areas of China and several thousand years ago, no one knows how exactly, there… I mean… there are stories… it became clear that if you consumed the leaves of this plant especially the younger leaves, then it had an interesting effect on you. And that effect could be thought of as medicinal or it could be thought of as just kind of sanative – making you feel a bit better than you used to feel. </span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Professor Markman Ellis tells us that people in Ancient China <strong>consumed</strong> – or ate – leaves from the tea plant and it had an interesting effect on them. </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Professor Ellis says tea has a <strong>sanative</strong> effect – making you feel better – so I might try munching a few leaves later on.</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Alright then. Apparently the Chinese started drinking tea because of its <strong>medicinal</strong> – or healing – qualities. And they've been drinking tea for thousands of years! Well we British may love a good cup of tea – but we haven’t been brewing it for nearly so long as the Chinese.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>But remember that tea actually grows in China, Alice. We don't grow it in Britain.</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Good point, Neil. Which brings me back to what we were talking about earlier. In the 19th c</span><span>entury the British started to grow tea in India in order to compete with Chinese tea production. When tea first arrived in Britain in the 17th c</span><span>entury it was incredibly expensive and only the elite could afford to drink it.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span><strong>Elite</strong> means a small group of people in society who have money and power. Well, the opposite is true today – everyone drinks tea! And cheap teabags make really strong tea – just the way I like it!</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>[noise of disgust] Oh, it's not for me! I like tea with a delicate flavour – Lapsang Suchong is my favourite with its evocative fragrance.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Not teabags, then? </span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>No, Neil. Lapsang is different from other types of tea because the leaves are smoke-dried over pinewood fires giving the tea its distinctive smoky flavour.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>You sound like a TV advert – I can just see the misty mountains and fields of tea… Can you tell us what <strong>evocative</strong> means?</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>It means making you imagine something pleasant. And for some people tea drinking is a spiritual experience. Let’s listen to BBC reporter Mike Williams learning about the Asian custom of the tea ceremony.</span></p><p><strong><span>INSERT<br/>Mike Williams and his Chinese host<br/></span></strong><span><strong>CH:</strong> Please enjoy a mouthful of green tea.<br/></span><span><strong>MW:</strong> Thank you... That was a bit less than a mouthful. It's a very very small amount, isn't it?<br/></span><span><strong>CH:</strong> It's about 20ml. It's the way to appreciate tea in very small quantities so you can concentrate and cultivate your mindfulness in drinking the tea.<br/></span><span><strong>MW:</strong> Mindfulness? What do you mean by mindfulness?<br/></span><span><strong>CH:</strong> Tea ceremony has some of its origin in Buddhism. The Japanese tea ceremony for example has a lot of Zen Buddhism influence. Mindfulness is the concentration and focus on the now – forget about the past, forget about the future, and enjoy this specific moment. And that's what I call mindfulness. </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>So they don't use mugs in the tea ceremony. It's 20 millilitres or a mouthful of green tea. </span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>That's right. Drinking just a <strong>mouthful</strong> – or a small amount – helps you concentrate and cultivate mindfulness. As the speaker explains, <strong>mindfulness</strong> means living in the moment and forgetting about the past and future. </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, forgive me for thinking about the past – but how about the answer to today’s quiz question?</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>OK then. I asked: Where was the teabag invented? Was it in… </span><span>a) China?, </span><span>b) the US? of </span><span>c) Britain?</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And I said c) Britain. And I must be right.</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Well, I'm afraid you're wrong, Neil! It was b) the US. Teabags first appeared commercially in the first decade of the 20th c</span><span>entury and were successfully marketed by Thomas Sullivan, a tea merchant from New York, who shipped his teabags around the world.</span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Really? Teabags are older than I thought! Now, can you tell us the words we heard today?</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>They are:<br/></span><span>brew<br/></span><span>consumed<br/></span><span>sanative<br/></span><span>medicinal<br/></span><span>elite<br/></span><span>evocative<br/></span><span>mouthful<br/></span><span>mindfulness</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

I'm Neil…</span></p><p><span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>… and I'm Alice. Now Neil, how do you get to work?</span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong></span><span>I cycle.</span></p><p><span><strong>Alice<br/></strong></span><span>I didn't know that! Somehow I hadn't imagined you as a cyclist. And where's all your bike gear?</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, I sneak in the mornings, have a shower, and get changed. That's my bike in the corner over there.</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Oh, you've got a <strong>foldaway</strong> bike – which means it folds up so it's easy to carry or put away. </span><span>Do you wear lycra, Neil?  </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, I do… it's very comfortable. I wear lycra as often as I can. <strong>Lycra</strong> by the way is a stretchy fabric used in tight-fitting sports clothes. </span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Well, I'll have to see if I can catch you on your way into the building – I'm <strong>intrigued</strong> about this sporty Neil I didn't know about!</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>'Intrigued' means to be very interested in something. Well, Alice, I'm flattered. And today's show is about <strong>commuting</strong> – or travelling between your home and your work. So how did you commute this morning, Alice?</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>I got the <strong>Tube</strong> – that's the subway system here in London, also known as the underground – and it was a nightmare. We stopped in a tunnel for so long that people started talking to each other.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And for those of you who aren't Londoners, that's unusual! Do you ever talk to people on the train?</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>No. People think you're crazy if you talk to strangers.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, maybe now's a good time to talk about today's quiz question, Alice. What question do you have for me?</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Alright then. I know you like my questions, Neil. So here we go: What did the word 'commuter' originally describe? Was it someone who… <br/></span><span>a) travelled with other people?<br/></span><span>b) paid a reduced fare to travel?<br/></span><span>Or c) travelled by train to work?</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Oh, that's easy. I'm going to go for c) travelled by train to work.</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Well, we'll find out later whether you're right or not. Now let's listen to a commuter in Nairobi who takes a matatu to get to work. These are minibuses used as shared taxis in East Africa. Can you spot a word that means being quick to notice things going on around you?</span></p><p><span><strong>INSERT<br/>Commuter, Nairobi, Kenya<br/></strong></span><span>When I'm stuck in the matatu there is a lot of strange things happen around you, so you have to be alert in Nairobi. When you open… when you leave your window open somebody can run away with your belongings. You may be speaking… using the phone… somebody just snatch your phone… you may expect the unexpected!  </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>The word used by this commuter in Kenya is <strong>alert</strong>. And in these noisy, crowded buses you need to be alert in case someone runs away with your belongings – <strong>belongings</strong> are the things that you own.</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Right. Somebody might snatch your phone – <strong>snatch</strong> means to take something quickly. </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Public transport in Nairobi sounds stressful! If I was taking the bus I'd want to have a <strong>nap</strong> – or short sleep.</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Yes. Well, people have done research on commuting and stress levels – and interestingly women are more likely to experience stress during their journey than men. </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Why's that? </span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Well, they're more likely to do something which is being called 'trip chaining' – where they make one or more stops on the way to work or going home – for example to drop off or pick up the kids from school – and this makes it more likely that something will go wrong with their journey.  </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Even if you aren't trip chaining it's no fun being stuck in a <strong>traffic jam</strong> – that's a large number of vehicles ​close together ​moving ​slowly – or being packed into a crowded train like sardines. Let's face it – travelling by car or by public transport can be really miserable! </span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Yes.<strong> Packed in like sardines</strong> describes people standing so close together that they can't move – like fish in a can! So let's hear how longer commutes can affect your health from US researcher Christine Hoehner.</span></p><p><span><strong>INSERT<br/>Christine Hoehner, researcher at Washington University School of Medicine<br/></strong></span><span>My study found that adults who commuted longer distances from home to work were less physically active, less physically fit, weighed more and had higher blood pressure than those people who had shorter commutes.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>The American researcher must be talking about commuters who aren't engaged in active travel, mustn't she? Because if you cycle a longer distance then you're being more physically active.</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>I think you're right, for once, Neil!</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yeah. </span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>And I'd better start going to the gym more. I don't like the sound of high blood pressure. </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Why don't you hop on your bike, Alice? Then we can both wear lycra to work.</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>That's a fantastic idea, Neil! Moving on! Here's the answer to today's quiz question. I asked: What did the word 'commuter' originally describe? Was it someone who… a) travelled with other people? b) paid a reduced fare to travel? Or c) travelled by train to work?</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And I said c) travelled by train to work. It must be right.</span></p><p><strong><span data-mce-mark=""1"">Alice<br/></span></strong><span data-mce-mark=""1"">And you were wrong I'm afraid, Neil! It's b) someone who paid a reduced fare to travel. The Oxford Dictionary says the word 'commute' comes from Latin <em>commutare</em>, from <em>com-</em> 'altogether' + <em>mutare</em> 'to change'. The word was used in the US in the 1840s, when people paid a reduced or <strong>commuted</strong> fare to travel by rail from the suburbs into the city.</span></p><p><span data-mce-mark=""1""><strong>Neil<br/></strong>OK.

Did you know that one of the producers, here, has an allergy to peanuts?  </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>No, I didn't – but they're not in the studio with us, so it doesn't matter, does it?</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>It only takes a tiny piece of peanut to cause a big allergic reaction in some people. An <strong>allergy</strong> by the way, is a condition that makes you feel ill after eating, touching or breathing in a particular substance. </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And food allergies are the subject of today's show. </span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Alright, put your peanuts down, Neil and answer today's quiz question. What substance is used to treat a severe allergic reaction? Is it…<br/></span><span>a) penicillin?<br/></span><span>b) adrenalin?<br/></span><span>Or c) aspirin?</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>OK, well, I'm going to go for a) penicillin.</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Well, we'll find out if that's the right answer later on. Now let's listen to Dr Marianne Williams talking about why being too clean may not be a good thing. She is a dietician here in the UK.</span></p><p><span><strong>INSERT<br/>Dr Marianne Williams, gastroenterology dietician, UK<br/></strong></span><span>For roughly the first month of life the immune system is switched off in essence and everything they [babies] get exposed to in that first month in life – dogs, cats, aunts, uncles, grannies, grandpas, family, dirt – everything – that is where they build up all the bacteria that are then going to colonise their gut in the future. Now, if you're born into a very sterile environment, as is increasingly the case in the western world, everything's kept terribly clean, and one of the theories is that we just are not getting enough exposure to a variety of bacteria at that very very early stage in that first month of life.</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Dr Marianne Williams. The <strong>immune system</strong> is our body's defence against infection. And it's <strong>switched off</strong> – or not working – for the first month of a baby's life.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And through exposure to lots of things in our environment – that's family, pets, dirt and so on – young babies meet different bacteria for the first time which <strong>colonise</strong> – or live and grow in – their guts.</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, but in a sterile environment babies don't <strong>get</strong> <strong>exposed to </strong>– or don't meet – a wide enough variety of bacteria.<strong> Sterile</strong> means completely clean and free of bacteria. And there's a theory that being too clean and bacteria-free – now we have soap, antibiotics and better sanitation – has lead to an increase in allergies.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>So dirty play for babies is good – mud, pets, picking stuff up off the floor and eating it.</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Did you use to eat food off the floor when you were little, Neil?</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Used to? I still do. I enjoy food from the floor! </span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Well, Neil, what can I say? We're both lucky to be allergy-free. I have a friend who has an allergy to <strong>gluten</strong> – a protein found in wheat and some other grains – and she has to be very careful about what she eats so she doesn't get ill.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>The supermarkets are quite helpful, though, aren't they, with products 'free from this' and 'free from that'? </span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>This is helpful, yes. But the food industry is now marketing their products to attract consumers who don't have a <strong>proven</strong> – or tested – allergy. </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Why would you buy free-from foods if you don't have a food allergy? </span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Well, people have started to believe that certain foods – like gluten or dairy – are bad for us, though there isn't any medical evidence to support this. Let's hear about how <strong>rickets</strong> – a disease caused by a lack of Vitamin D in the diet – is affecting some children in the UK. This is BBC reporter Mike Williams.</span></p><p><span><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Mike Williams,</strong> <strong>BBC reporter<br/></strong>R</span><span>ickets is common in the developing world but this is London in the 21st </span><span>century. These children aren't malnourished because they're too poor to eat well – it's the opposite. Their often middle-class parents are spending money to give them foods with ingredients taken out.

The correct answer is b) adrenalin. An injection of adrenalin can be used to treat <strong>anaphylaxis</strong> – or severe allergic reactions – to insect stings, foods, drugs, and other allergens.

I'm Alice…</span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>… and I'm Neil. </span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>So Neil, did you sleep well last night?</span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Um, yes, thanks. Why do you ask?</span></p><p><span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Today we're talking about how much sleep we need. </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>I like a good eight hours myself – ten at the weekend. How about you?</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Six is enough for me. But did you know this? Humans sleep around three hours less than other primates like chimps, who sleep for about ten hours. So you're a chimp, Neil – at the weekends, at least! Are you ready for the quiz question?</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>[makes some chimp noises]</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>OK, I'll assume that means yes. Right. What's another word for sleepwalking? Is it…<br/></span><span>a) narcolepsy?<br/></span><span>b) restless legs syndrome?<br/></span><span>or c) somnambulism?</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>I will go for b) restless legs syndrome, since there's a connection there with the legs. </span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Well we'll find out whether you're right or wrong later on in the show. So what keeps you awake at night, Neil?  </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Not much, to be honest. I usually <strong>sleep like a log</strong> – and that means very heavily indeed! But sometimes my own snoring wakes me up, and then I can find it hard to get back to sleep. <strong>Snoring</strong>, for those of you who don't know, means breathing in a noisy way through your mouth or nose while you're asleep. [snores] … like that… How about you, Alice?</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Very good, yes. Well, that's quite ridiculous! Anyway, for me, it's drinking too much coffee during the day. It's the <strong>caffeine</strong> in coffee – a chemical that makes you feel more awake – which can stop you from sleeping at night. But there are so many things that can keep us awake these days. </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Oh yes. Radio, TV… techy stuff like 24-hour internet, computers, smart phones. I love my phone and it's never far from me!</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Well, let's hear what Professor Jerome Siegel, from the University of California, found when he studied the sleep habits of three different hunter-gatherer communities who have very little contact with modern society. They don't have artificial light, electricity, batteries, or any of the gadgets that we rely on today.</span></p><p><strong><span>INSERT<br/></span></strong><span><strong>Professor Jerome Siegel, from the University of California, US<br/></strong></span><span>Their sleep was not that different from ours. The range of sleep period was about 6.9 to 8.5 hours. If you actually measure sleep in current populations in the United States or in Europe they're definitely at the low end of what's been reported. They certainly don't sleep a lot less than we do but they clearly don't sleep more.</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Professor Jerome Siegel found that people in these communities don't go to bed until several hours after sundown – just like us! But one big difference is that very few of them suffer from <strong>insomnia</strong> – which means having difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Now, I don't have a problem with insomnia. And <strong>hunter-gatherers</strong> – people who live by hunting animals and gathering plants to eat – don't either – probably because they take a lot of physical exercise during the day.</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, that's right. Taking exercise is an important factor in sleeping <strong>soundly</strong> – or well – at night. But these days our minds can be so active that it becomes very difficult to fall asleep. Let's listen to Professor Kevin Morgan, from Loughborough University here in England, talking about how cognitive behavioural therapy can be used to help people with insomnia.</span></p><p><span><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Professor Kevin Morgan, Loughborough University, England<br/></strong></span><span>If you have a train of thoughts which would otherwise keep you awake one way of dealing with this is to block those thoughts. What I'd like you to do is repeat the word 'the' in your mind at irregular intervals – the the the the the the the the the – what you'll find (is) that the mind space required to do this blocks out almost everything else.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>So Professor Kevin Morgan suggests saying one word over and over again at irregular intervals – <strong>irregular</strong> in this context means not spaced out evenly. Doing it can help to block out the thoughts that are stopping you from getting to sleep. It sounds like a very simple solution. I wonder if it works?</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>There's one way to find out, Neil. Try it yourself!</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>I will.</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>OK. And <strong>cognitive behavioural therapy</strong> by the way is a treatment for mental health problems that tries to change the way you think.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, I usually count sheep if I can't get to sleep. Do you do that, Alice?</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>No, not usually. No. OK, I think it's time for the answer to our quiz question. I asked: What's another word for sleepwalking? Is it… a) narcolepsy? b) restless legs syndrome? or c) somnambulism?</span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I said b) restless legs syndrome.</span></p><p><span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Sorry, Neil, it's actually c) somnambulism – the roots of this word come from Latin. <em>Somnus</em> means 'sleep' and and <em>ambulare</em> means 'walk'. Narcolepsy is a condition where you can't stop yourself falling asleep, especially during the day. </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Narcolepsy… (says in a sleepy way)</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>And restless legs syndrome is a condition that makes you desperate to move your legs around, especially when you're sitting quietly or trying to get to sleep. </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>… get to sleep… (murmuring)</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Neil! Wake up! </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Oh, hello Alice! Sorry.</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Hello!

I'm Neil…</span></p><p><span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>… and I'm Alice. Now Neil, I'm a big fan of chat shows, as you know. But what do you think makes a good interview?</span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I like it when the interviewer asks a question that <strong>catches</strong> the guest <strong>off guard</strong>. You know – to surprise them so they're embarrassed and don't know what to say. </span></p><p><span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>That's not very nice! </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>I know. But it's great TV. That's what chat shows are all about, isn't it?</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Well, I don't agree, Neil! A <strong>chat show</strong>, by the way, is a TV or radio programme where a <strong>host</strong> – the person who presents the show – talks to guest celebrities about various topics. And what makes a good interview is the subject of today's show. </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>So what's a good interview technique, Alice?</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Well, asking <strong>open questions</strong> – questions the celebrities can't easily respond to with a short answer. Open questions give them the chance to talk and possibly reveal some juicy details about themselves!</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span><strong>Juicy details </strong>means information you find interesting because it's exciting or shocking. </span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Yes. So let's test your interviewing skills, Neil. Ask me something – see if you can get some juicy details. </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>OK… Hmm… How much do you weigh?</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>How much do I weigh? </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yeah.</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>How much do <em>you</em> weigh? Look, that's a <strong>closed question</strong> – you're going to get a short answer and no juicy details! And more importantly, Neil, it's a rude question!</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>OK – bad choice. Sorry. But your reaction was juicy – you got pretty <strong>hot under the collar</strong> – and that means embarrassed or angry! I'll try to think of a better question to ask you before the end of the show.</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Alright then. Now, since you aren't good at <em>asking</em> questions, perhaps you can <em>answer</em> one instead. Who developed a method of questioning around two and a half thousand years ago that aims to discover hidden truths? Was it…<br/></span><span>a) Hippocrates?<br/></span><span>b) Socrates?<br/></span><span>Or c) Aristotle?</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, I don't know much about ancient history so I'm going to guess c) Aristotle.</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Well, we'll find out if you picked the right answer later on – but now let's listen to Larry King talking about the secret of his successful career as a TV chat show host. Can you spot a word that means to get or produce?</span></p><p><span><strong>INSERT<br/>Larry King, TV chat show host, US<br/></strong></span><span>If you ask good questions and you elicit thoughtful answers then you learn more about the person. If the interview's hard – if I begin by saying, 'Why did you do that?' I'd make you defensive. That may be thrilling television, but you don't learn a lot. I learned that the more I drew back, asked good questions, listened to the answers, cared about the guest … you make the camera disappear.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>The word Larry King used is… <strong>elicit</strong>. </span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Right. And <em>you</em> elicited a defensive reaction from me when you asked a not very thoughtful question about my weight. <strong>Defensive</strong> means protecting yourself from criticism or attack. </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>OK, I wouldn't make a good chat show host then.</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>You're right there. So good interviewers <strong>draw back</strong> – or move away – from being the centre of attention. They're good listeners and care about their guests. Sound familiar? </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Are you suggesting that you're a good interviewer?</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Yup.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>OK, well, so why aren't you a top chat show host, hmm? What does Larry mean when he says you have to<strong> make the camera disappear</strong>?</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>It means to make the conversation real – as if you were chatting with a friend – rather than performing to a TV audience. But let's hear more from Larry King on the secret of his success.</span></p><p><strong><span>INSERT</span></strong><br/><span><strong>Larry King, TV chat show host, US<br/></strong></span><span>I don't want a 'no'. I don't want a 'yes'. I want a 'why'. So in other words, I want to be a little kind of dumb. My friend Herbie said the secret of my success is being dumb. 'What do you mean by that?' </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>So you have to ask <strong>dumb</strong> – or stupid – questions to make a great chat show host! I knew it!</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Maybe there's hope for you yet, Neil.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Charming.</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Lovely. OK, here's the answer to today's quiz question. I asked: Who developed a method of questioning around two and a half thousand years ago that aims to discover hidden truths? Was it… a) Hippocrates? b) Socrates? Or c) Aristotle?</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And I said c) Aristotle.</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>No, it was b) Socrates. All three were famous Greek philosophers but Socrates was the one who angered lots of important people by his <strong>probing</strong> – or investigative – questions – and this technique is called Socratic Dialogue. Socrates lived from 469 to 399 BC and he influenced philosophy so much that all previous thinkers have come to be known as Pre-Socratic. Despite this he declared ""All I know is that I know nothing"".</span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Very noble. OK, a final question for you, Alice. What makes you happy? </span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Working with such a fantastic co-presenter, Neil. </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>That's nice!

I look fat, don't I?</span></p><p><span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well… er… Did you overindulge during the Christmas holidays, Neil?</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>I'm afraid I did, Alice. <strong>Overindulge</strong> means to have too much of something nice – like all that lovely Christmas food!</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, lovely. Why do you think appearance is so important to us, Neil? Getting in shape is a very popular <strong>New Year's resolution </strong>– that's a decision to do or stop doing something at the beginning of the New Year.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Good question. Well, I think we all judge people according to the way they look. </span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>The subject of today's show is <strong>appearance</strong> or the way we look.

Well, show us you aren't just a pretty face by getting today's quiz question right. From a study done in the UK, which physical aspect of their appearance were men most likely to say was their favourite? Was it…<br/></span><span>a) their hair?<br/></span><span>b) their face?<br/></span><span>Or c) their height?<br/><br/></span><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>OK, I'm going for a) hair.

Now, it's not only people who make quick decisions about others based on the way they look. Some animals do this too. Peahens – that's a female peacock - prefer male peacocks with lots of eyespots on their tail.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Why's that?</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Well, one theory is that a male peacock's tail is a sign of his genes. <strong>Genes</strong> are part of the DNA in a cell that controls the physical development and behaviour of an animal. It takes lots of energy to grow a big tail, and to carry it around, so only the strongest, healthiest males can afford to do this.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>So what do men need in order to attract women, Alice? </span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>A deep voice and a square jaw, according to research.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, let's listen now to fashion historian Amber Butchart describing what men used to do to <strong>enhance</strong> – or improve – their physical appearance. </span></p><p><span><strong>INSERT<br/>Amber Butchart, fashion historian and analyst<br/></strong></span><span>Men quite often would wear corsets throughout [the] 18<sup>th</sup> Century even into the 19<sup>th</sup> Century. It was possibly concerned with displaying status and rank rather than what we now define as physical attractiveness but I think the two were very bound up together. </span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>This was Amber Butchart. A <strong>corset</strong> is a tight-fitting piece of underwear that squeezes you in and makes your waist look smaller.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>I didn't know men used to wear corsets! That might make you talk in a high voice – and that wouldn't be very attractive, would it?</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Well, no, Neil. It's a very interesting look and sound for you… On a more serious note, Amber says that men weren't wearing these uncomfortable <strong>garments</strong> – or clothes – just to look more physically attractive – they were also doing it to display their status and rank.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span><strong>Status</strong> means the professional or social position of a person in relation to others. And <strong>rank</strong> is another way of saying the same thing. Do you think we still dress to impress, Alice – or are things a bit freer than they were in the 18<sup>th</sup> Century? I'm a jeans and T-shirt man, as you know. </span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Well yes, indeed, you don't have to be <strong>suited and booted</strong> for our job – and that means smartly dressed. But I think the way we dress is still important. But for women, particularly, I think we dress nicely for ourselves – not for anybody else. Sometimes I put on make-up – not because I'm going out – but because it makes me feel good.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>You always look nice – with or without make-up, Alice.<br/><br/></span><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Thank you, Neil! That's very nice. But let's listen now to academic Philippa Dietrich from the University of the West of England, Bristol, talking about valuing ourselves for all our attributes – not just our appearance.<br/><br/></span><span><strong>INSERT<br/>Philippa Dietrich, University of the West of England, Bristol<br/></strong></span><span>This focus just on appearance – on looks – really sends people the ideas that their bodies are just objects to be looked at. Having a belief system or focussing on your values in life or other attributes or personality characteristics or interests or anything else that's not to do with appearance is really important. Our bodies are not there to be looked that – they have functions.<br/><br/></span><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>What Philippa Dietrich said makes sense to me. We need to focus on our inner beauty. What do you think, Alice?</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Well, I think you should stop posting selfies on social media then, Neil! Now here's the answer to today's quiz question. I asked: From a study done in the UK, which physical aspect of their appearance were men most likely to say was their favourite? Was it… a) their hair? b) their face? Or c) their height?</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And I said a) hair. </span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>And you were wrong I'm afraid, Neil! It's c) height. A poll conducted by ComRes for BBC Radio found that when it comes to appearance, men were most likely to mention their height - 21% of them in fact said it was their favourite physical attribute whereas for women, 35% of them said their hair was their favourite thing. </span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, forget about my hair, Alice - I'm tall too, OK, so… you can tell us the words we heard today, please?</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Here they are:<br/></span><span>get in shape<br/></span><span>overindulge<br/></span><span>New Year's resolution<br/></span><span>appearance<br/></span><span>genes<br/></span><span>corset<br/></span><span>garments<br/></span><span>status<br/></span><span>rank<br/></span><span>suited and booted</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

I'm Alice…</span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I'm Neil… Did you get all your Christmas shopping done, Alice?</span></p><p><span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>I did, Neil. And I spent <strong>a small fortune</strong> – and that means a lot of money!</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, I hate buying all those presents that people just don't really want. </span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Oh, Neil, you grumpy old Scrooge! And I hope you realise that the subject of today's show is Christmas kindness!</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Oh dear. I might be <strong>grumpy</strong> – and that means bad-tempered – but I'm not a scrooge! I don't mind spending money – I just don't know what to buy people. Ebenezer Scrooge is the main character in Charles Dickens' novel <em>A Christmas Carol</em>. He's a <strong>miser</strong> – and that means someone who loves money but hates spending it. </span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Indeed. Well, on the subject of <em>A Christmas Carol</em>, Neil, at the end of the story, what does Scrooge buy the Cratchit family for Christmas dinner? Is it…<br/></span><span>a) a goose?<br/></span><span>b) a turkey?<br/></span><span>Or c) a chicken?</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Hmm. Well, I haven't read the book so I'm going to guess a) a goose. </span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Well, we'll find out later if you chose the right answer. Now, Neil, I agree that Christmas shopping can sometimes feel pointless – but we mustn't forget what a magical time Christmas is for young children. </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, that's true. I remember how hard it was to get to sleep on Christmas Eve – worrying that Santa Claus would get stuck in our chimney. </span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, well,<strong> eve</strong> means the day before something – in this case, Christmas Day. Parents tell their children that <strong>Santa Claus</strong> – an imaginary old man with a white beard and red clothes – will bring them presents at Christmas time. In the UK children believe that Santa comes down the chimney to get into the house.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>But it's not all fun. Increasing numbers of people these days are struggling for money at this time of year. Having enough food to feed their family is what matters most and buying presents comes further down the list. So let's listen now to a BBC Scotland report by Laura Maxwell. She's talking about a special event with lots of presents.</span></p><p><span><strong>INSERT<br/>Laura Maxwell, BBC Scotland, and Beatrice Caddell<br/></strong></span><span><strong>LM:</strong> Beatrice Cadell has just celebrated her 80</span><span><sup><span>th </span></sup></span><span>birthday. And instead of presents for her, she asked her friends to buy toys. <br/></span><span><strong>BC:</strong> Everyone that turned up to that birthday do was absolutely brilliant. Absolutely brilliant. And it's good for something like this. It's even better. It's even better – you know – somebody else can benefit. We don't need it. We're old. </span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>So Beatrice is celebrating her birthday and she told friends and family to buy toys instead of presents for her.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Right. She had the generous idea of <strong>donating</strong> – or giving – the toys to a <strong>toy bank</strong> – a place where toys are given away free to people in need. The toy bank then distributed Beatrice's toys to parents who couldn't afford to buy presents for their children at Christmas.</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Yes. So Beatrice is happy that children can <strong>benefit</strong> – or be helped by her. She says she doesn't need presents. A woman <strong>after your own heart</strong>, Neil!</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Indeed! And that means Beatrice has the same opinion as me! Well, that's a great example of Christmas charity – and <strong>charity</strong> means giving free help to people who need it. </span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Yes. And here's another example, Neil. Last year in London, twenty tons of presents were donated, wrapped, and delivered to a local hospital to cheer up sick children who couldn't go home for Christmas.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Were they delivered in Santa's sleigh?</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>No Neil, they were delivered in a big double-decker bus! Let's hear about the volunteers who made this happen. </span></p><p><strong><span>INSERT<br/>Volunteer<br/></span></strong><span>Lots of different groups of people come together under the banner of kindness – so religious people come together, corporate people come together, young people, old people – it seems to be something that stretches across many many many different demographics.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span><strong>Under the banner of kindness</strong> – what does that mean, Alice? </span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Well,<strong> being under the banner of something</strong> means being part of a group who are united in support for an idea. And in this case, different people came together to do something kind for sick children.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And demographics? What's that?</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span><strong>Demographics</strong> means statistical information about a population and the groups of people in it. People from different groups in society are working together – the old and the young, religious people, corporate – or business – people.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And this talk of kindness is making me feel more in the mood for Christmas! </span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>I can see that, Ebenezer. You've got a smile on your face! Now, earlier in the show, I asked: At the end of the story, what does Scrooge buy the Cratchit family for Christmas dinner? Is it… a) a goose? b) a turkey? Or c) a chicken?</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And I said a) a goose.</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Yes. And you were wrong, Neil! The answer is b) a turkey. </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>That makes me a goose.</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>It certainly does. Scrooge buys the Cratchit family the prize turkey hanging. Delicious! <em>A Christmas Carol</em> is a lovely story. Everybody should read it.</span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And did you know that although turkeys are traditional Christmas food now, they weren't in Dickens's time.</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>I see...</span><span> </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>They were <strong>exotic</strong> back then – and that means unusual because it comes from another country. The story was written in 1843. Now how about hearing the words we learned today, Alice?</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>They are:<br/></span><span>a small fortune<br/></span><span>grumpy<br/></span><span>miser<br/></span><span>eve<br/></span><span>Santa Claus<br/></span><span>donating<br/></span><span>toy bank<br/></span><span>benefit<br/></span><span>after your own heart<br/></span><span>charity<br/></span><span>under the banner of something<br/></span><span>demographics<br/></span><span>exotic</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

You're off on holiday tomorrow, aren't you?</span></p><p><span><strong>Finn<br/></strong>I am and you know, and I'm dreading it. I hate flying! </span></p><p><span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Do you? I didn't know you had a <strong>phobia</strong> – and that means a strong and unreasonable fear of something.  </span></p><p><span><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Well, I don't think this is a phobia because it isn't unreasonable. Flying thousands of feet up in the sky in a tin can, you know, that's not safe! </span></p><p><span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Flying is safer than you think, Finn. It's much riskier to drive or cycle to work. And, actually, risk taking is the subject of today's show! <strong>Risk</strong> means the chances of something bad happening. For example, did you know that your chance of being knocked off your bicycle and killed during a one-mile journey is the same as your chances of winning the lottery?</span></p><p><span><strong>Finn<br/></strong>You know Alice, I didn't know that. </span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>And this leads me on to our quiz question for today: What are the odds … what are the chances of either of these two things happening? Is it…<br/></span><span>a) 1 in 4 million?<br/></span><span>b) 1 in 14 million?<br/></span><span>Or c) 1 in 400 million?</span></p><p><span><strong>Finn<br/></strong>I have no idea. I'll go with the big number: 1 in 400 million, c).</span></p><p><span><strong>Alice </strong>OK. So we'll find out later if you're right or wrong later on. Now let's listen to Andreas Wilkey, a psychologist at Clarkson University in New York, talking about why we're bad at assessing risk. </span></p><p><span><strong>INSERT </strong><strong>Andreas Wilkey, Psychologist, Clarkson University, Potsdam, New York<br/></strong></span><span>People typically fear anything which is small probability but it's extremely catastrophic if it were to happen… Think about dying in a plane crash, think about a nuclear meltdown from the nearby power plant. Recently we have another increase in these birds' virus outbreaks in South Korea. People read about that. And they may pay a lot of attention to that in the news but they may forget to get their flu shot. </span></p><p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>That was Andreas Wilkey from Clarkson University. And we heard that a small <strong>probability</strong> of something happening means it's unlikely to happen. But we worry about big or catastrophic events such as catching bird flu or dying in a plane crash because we have a <strong>gut</strong> <strong>reaction </strong>to them– in other words, we react emotionally. A <strong>catastrophic</strong> event is something that causes a huge amount of damage and suffering.</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>And it's often because of <strong>media coverage</strong> – for example, watching the news and reading the newspapers – that it can be difficult for us to understand how likely certain things are to happen. Catastrophic events feel like very real threats, while we tend to forget about the small but chronic risks that become more likely over time.</span></p><p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>We do.<strong> Chronic</strong> means something that lasts for a long time. So for example, what if there was a cigarette that killed you as soon as you smoked it? Nobody would do that, would they?</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>No, they wouldn't.</span></p><p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>But plenty of people are happy to smoke for years, and put off worrying about the health risks for the future.</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, that's a good point, Finn! People feel they are in control of risks that stretch over time. You know, they think, 'I could stop tomorrow' or 'I could smoke less'. But what about people who enjoy taking big risks – those <strong>thrill seekers</strong> out there? </span></p><p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>People who enjoy extreme sports actually seek out danger – it gives them extreme pleasure! So let's listen to Karina Hollekim from Norway. She's a <strong>base jumper</strong> – that's a person with a parachute who leaps from tall buildings or cliffs – and she's talking about what she feels about risk.</span></p><p><span><strong>INSERT </strong><strong>Karina Hollekim, base jumper<br/></strong></span><span>You need to measure the pleasure. Is it going to be worth it for you? So if the risk is really high, it means that the pleasure needs to be equally high. Or hopefully even higher… You can't measure it on a scale or anything. For me, it's a stomach feeling. It's the value within me, and I'm the only one who can tell what value it has to me. </span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Yes. It must be a magical feeling to step off a cliff, mustn't it, Finn?</span></p><p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>'It's a stomach feeling', you know – my stomach would definitely be saying, 'oh no, no, no!' So why not change the subject and give me the answer to today's quiz question?</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>I asked: What are your chances of being knocked off your bicycle and killed during a one-mile journey and this is the same as your chances of winning the national lottery? So is it… a) 1 in 4 million? b) 1 in 14 million? Or c) 1 in 400 million?</span></p><p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>I said c) 1 in 400 million.</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Yes. And you were wrong, Finn. </span></p><p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>Alright. Really? OK.</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Yes. The odds are actually 1 in 14 million. You are as likely to win the national lottery from a single ticket as you are to be knocked off your bicycle and killed during a one-mile journey. This statistic comes from the Professor David Spiegelhalter, who is Winton Professor of the Public Understanding of Risk in the Statistical Laboratory at the University of Cambridge in the UK. So I think he really knows his stuff.</span></p><p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>That's a very long title, yes, I'm sure he does. </span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Yeah.</span></p><p><strong><span>Finn<br/></span></strong><span>So let's hear today's words again, Alice?</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Here they are:<br/></span><span>phobia<br/></span><span>risk<br/></span><span>probability<br/></span><span>gut reaction<br/></span><span>catastrophic<br/></span><span>media coverage<br/></span><span>chronic<br/></span><span>thrill seekers<br/></span><span>base jumper<br/></span><span>And that brings us to the end of today's 6 Minute English.

So, Neil, do you think you're looking back at your university days <strong>through rose-tinted spectacles</strong>?

I'm one of those men who isn't good at talking about their feelings, Alice. I just felt a bit <strong>homesick</strong> that's all – I missed my friends and family. But let's move on, shall we! Why don't you ask me today's quiz question? </span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Alright then. So here it is: In a survey of students at Imperial College London, how many students said they suffered from high levels of stress or a mental health condition during their time at college?

And <strong>stress</strong> means pressure or worry caused by a difficult situation. OK, we'll find out if you're right or wrong later on. Now in the UK, there has been a rise in students using counselling services.</span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Why's that, Alice? </span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Well, let's listen to Kirsty, a student at Exeter University, talking about why she has had problems. And here's a question for you while you listen: Did she enjoy her first days in college?</span></p><p><strong><span>INSERT</span></strong><br/><span><strong>Kirsty McMurron, student at Exeter University<br/></strong></span><span>No. The thing is… it… is a real balancing act. When I first got to university I don't think I'd really realized that I'd forgotten how to make friends you know, I'd been with the same school friends for seven years, and so I was trying to balance you know social success with academic success whilst learning how to look after myself at quite a young age. And I think that's the experience of a lot of young people. And people really struggle with it.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>What's a <strong>balancing act</strong>, Alice?</span></p><p><span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>It's where you try to give your attention to two or more things at the same time. So here, Kirsty is trying to balance making new friends with doing her academic work and learning to look after herself.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>What does Kirsty mean when she says she's learning to look after herself?</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Well, to <strong>look after someone</strong> means to protect or take care of someone – and in this case, Kirsty's learning to take care of herself – for example doing her own shopping and cooking. </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>OK, let's listen to Dr Ruth Caleb of the counselling service at Brunel University in London talking about what practical stuff students could learn before leaving for university that might make life easier for them.</span></p><p><span><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Dr Ruth Caleb, Head of the counselling service at Brunel University, London<br/></strong></span><span>Certain things that I think it would be very very helpful for students to have put in place are an ability to do the practical things of life – to do the washing, to do the cleaning and so on – being able to cook. Budgeting is extremely important in university life. And also spending time on your own comfortably.</span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, that's excellent advice. I couldn't boil an egg when I arrived at uni.</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice</span></strong><br/><span>Oh, really? Can you do it now, Neil? </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Just about, just about.</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Yeah? Great. And what about <strong>budgeting</strong>? This means planning how much money you have and how you will spend it.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil</span></strong><br/><span>I'm still pretty bad at that. However, I am very good at spending time on my own comfortably. </span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, I can believe that – feet up, watching TV with a takeaway. </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Takeaway, of course a takeaway cause I can't cook anything…</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>No.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>… not even an egg. You know me so well. So how about the answer to today's quiz question, Alice?</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Alright then. I asked: In a survey of students at Imperial College London, how many said they suffered from high levels of stress or a mental health condition during their time at college? Was it…<br/></span><span>a) 1 out of 4?<br/></span><span>b) 2 out of 4?<br/></span><span>or c) 3 out of 4?</span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I said c) 3 out of 4.</span></p><p><span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Yes. And you are correct – well done, Neil! The survey, completed by over a thousand students, also found that almost 70% of those that suffer from stress do so at least once a week, and 9% of students feel <strong>stressed</strong> constantly. Stressed means anxious and worried.</span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, I feel anxious just thinking about all that stress.

Neil and Alice discuss the long-lasting appeal of this man with a bow and how he has changed over the centuries.", 03 Dec 2015,"<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript</p><p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Alice…</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>… and I'm Neil. Hello.</p><p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>Hello, Neil. Now what do you know about Robin Hood?</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>OK. Well, he wore green tights…</p><p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>Yes, he did.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>He was good at archery… he had a girlfriend called Maid Marion. He was English – although he sometimes he has an American accent in Hollywood films.</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Yes.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>There was a great Disney cartoon series using animal characters. Robin and Maid Marion were foxes.</p><p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>Anything else? What about being an outlaw or criminal? Heroically fighting against injustice and corruption?</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Oh yeah, there's all that stuff as well – robbing the rich and giving to the poor. Yes, yeah… he lived in Sherwood Forest with a band of merry men.</p><p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>Yes, he did. OK, it sounds like you've watched a lot of TV and film versions but haven't read the literature.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Oh, come on, Alice! Have you read the literature?</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Yes I have. I studied English at university and one of my specialist subjects was medieval literature. The Middle Ages or medieval period lasted in Europe from the 5th to the 15th century.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>I see. And I'm guessing that Robin Hood is the subject of today's show?</p><p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>Absolutely. You're right! So here's a question for you, Neil: When do we find the first reference to Robin Hood in English literature? Was it in the…<br/>a) 5th century?<br/>b) 10th century?<br/>Or c) 14th century?</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Well, I'm going to go for the middle one – and that's b) 10th century.</p><p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>OK. Well, we'll find out if you're right or wrong later on. Now, why do you think the stories of Robin Hood have lasted from the Middle Ages through to the modern day?</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Well, I suppose it's got appeal on lots of levels – action, adventure – there's some comedy stuff there with the merry men. And of course, romance, like I said before.</p><p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>Yes, indeed. Actually the early versions of Robin Hood were very violent. Let's listen to Professor Thomas Hahn talk about one of the ballads called The Monk.</p><p><strong>INSERT</strong><br/><strong>Thomas Hahn, Professor of English Literature at the University of Rochester, New York<br/></strong>The Monk is, I think for most modern audiences who've either seen movies or read children's stories or whatever, quite disturbing in terms of its levels of violence. In terms of trying to make some comparisons with popular culture it seems to me that it's really at the level of Sopranos in terms of things like dismembered bodies and actual violence and assassinations.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>What's a ballad, Alice?</p><p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>Well, It's a song or poem that tells a story. People were telling the stories of Robin Hood for a long time before they were written down – and performing them too.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Really? And how about the comparison between the Robin Hood ballads and the Sopranos? Now The Sopranos is a popular US TV series about gangsters. Maybe I should get The Monk on audiobook. What do you think?</p><p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>Yes, I don’t think you'd find it disturbing – disturbing means making you feel upset or shocked. Assassinations are the murder of important people, often for political reasons. And dismembered bodies are bodies that have been cut or torn into pieces.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Right. It sounds like medieval entertainment for guys. You know, like martial arts movies these days.</p><p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>Well, yes, you may be right. Now do you remember you mentioned Maid Marion at the start of the show?</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>I do.</p><p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>Well, actually, in the early ballads there is no Maid Marian. She appears in later versions along with other characters we know well today. But Robin is always a trickster, and a man with a bow in a wood.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>A trickster is someone who deceives or cheats people. That's impressive, Alice. You certainly know your medieval ballads.</p><p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>Yes, I do. So what's so appealing about this man with a bow? Let's listen to Professor Hahn again.</p><p><strong>INSERT</strong><br/><strong>Thomas Hahn, Professor of English Literature at the University of Rochester, New York<br/></strong>What he represents I think is a kind of strong and forceful masculinity that operates on its own terms and for its own interests and that's I think what we admire in these stories.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>What does it mean to operate on your own terms, Alice?</p><p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>Well, Neil, it means to do what you want according to your own rules. And masculinity means the qualities typical of a man. Now, remember my question from earlier? I asked: When do we find the first reference to Robin Hood in English literature? Was it in the…<br/>a) 5th century?<br/>b) 10th century?<br/>Or c) 14th century?</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>And I said b) 10th century.</p><p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>Yes, well… I'm afraid you are wrong, Neil. The first reference occurs in the English poet William Langland's book Piers Plowman written between 1370 and 1390. Sloth, the lazy priest, says: ""I kan not parfitly my Paternoster as the preest it singeth,/ But I kan rymes of Robyn Hood and Randolf Erl of Chestre.""</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Well, Alice, can you translate that into modern English, please? Maybe that's for another show.</p><p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>Maybe another show…</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Can we just have today's words again, please?</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong>We certainly can. And we can have those in modern English. OK. Here they are:<br/>outlaw<br/>medieval period or Middle Ages<br/>ballad<br/>disturbing<br/>assassinations<br/>dismembered bodies<br/>trickster<br/>operate on your own terms<br/>masculinity</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Well, that brings us to the end of today's 6 Minute English.

Tune in to Neil and Alice to find out what they think about relationships and money and learn some related vocabulary.", 26 Nov 2015,"<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript</p><p><strong>Alice<br/></strong><span>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Alice…</span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>… and I'm Neil. Hello.</span></p><p><span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Hello, Neil. Now tell me, do you usually go dutch when you take someone out to dinner?</span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Now <strong>go dutch</strong> means to share the cost of something, for example a meal in a restaurant. Well Alice, no, I usually expect my date to pay actually. </span></p><p><span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>I hope you're joking, Neil. But I wouldn’t be surprised! Personally, I think it's a nice gesture to offer to pay for the meal when you're on a date. </span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yeah. But it can depend on the situation – some people might be very offended if you offered to pay for everything! </span></p><p><span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well yes, true. Clearly you're not going to offend those people, Neil, though are you? And I won’t be going to dinner with you any time soon. </span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, I didn't ask so calm down, Alice! Actually, money matters can cause relationship problems in couples – and that's the subject of the show. Here's today's quiz question based on a UK survey. Ready, Alice?</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>I am indeed.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>What percentage of married couples don't know exactly what their spouse earns? Is it:<br/></span><span>a) 4%?<br/></span><span>b) 14%?<br/></span><span>Or c) 44%</span></p><p><span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well, gosh! I think b) 14%. Yes, that sounds about right to me.</span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, we'll find out if you're right or wrong later on. Now, it seems important that couples are honest about their finances because it can have an impact on their future financial options together. </span></p><p><span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Yes, that's right. If you're buying a house together and then find out later that your <strong>spouse</strong> – your husband or wife – is thousands of pounds in debt, then the chances are you won't be able to get a mortgage. <strong>To be in debt</strong>, by the way, means to owe money to someone.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Good point. A <strong>mortgage</strong> is where a bank lends you money to buy a house. Let's listen now to what Arabella Russell, a relationship therapist, has to say about this. </span></p><p><span><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Arabella Russell, relationship therapist<br/></strong></span><span>The fact of the matter is it's very difficult – it can be very difficult – to talk about money. Often when we talk about money, it’s emotions very close to us – there's guilt, there's shame. What have we done in the past? To start those conversations is complicated. Money can be about how we value ourselves, how we feel valued. It’s not just a simple case of talking about hard cash. </span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Arabella talks about 'hard cash'. Now what does that mean? </span></p><p><strong><span>Alice</span></strong><br/><span>Well, we say <strong>hard cash</strong> when we talk about physical money – the coins and banknotes – as opposed to other types of payment.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil</span></strong><br/><span>And why do we find it so difficult to talk about cash, Alice?</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Well, because we get emotional about it! Arabella talks about feelings of guilt and shame. And for many of us, money isn't simply money – it can be about how we value ourselves or feel valued.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Right – so if I were to buy you a cheap engagement ring you would feel undervalued.</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Nice example, Neil! You can't be a cheapskate when it comes to engagement rings! So how much would you spend on our engagement ring, Neil?</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well… um… I didn't know we were getting married!  But if I was buying an engagement ring for you Alice, I think definitely I would spend about… you know around... in the region of … mmm pounds… </span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Sorry, Neil, I didn't quite catch that. Alright!</span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Are you calling me a cheapskate?</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>I certainly am, Neil. <strong>Cheapskate</strong> means someone who doesn't like spending money, by the way. Moving on – let's hear more from Arabella about how people have different attitudes towards money.</span></p><p><strong><span>INSERT</span></strong><br/><strong><span>Arabella Russell, relationship therapist<br/></span></strong><span>Accept the fact that in your relationship you might do money differently – there might be a spender there might be a saver. It’s very tempting if your partner does things differently to say they're wrong. They might do it differently because they see money differently. Do it differently but have a budget. Of course be honest about each other but recognise that you might just have a different view of money.</span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Now that sounds like excellent advice to me! I'm a saver, and I'm not ashamed to say it. Why waste money on an expensive engagement ring? Engagements don't always last. You might drop the ring down the kitchen sink or… </span></p><p><span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>How romantic, Neil! </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>… it could be stolen or you might meet someone else.</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice</span></strong><br/><span>Indeed. Now I know I shouldn't say you're wrong… but you're wrong! You have to invest in a relationship if you want it to work. </span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Calm down. I see money differently to you. I’m a saver and you’re a spender, and that’s all there is to it. And a <strong>budget</strong> means the money you have available for something and a plan for how to use it.</span></p><p><span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Well, we'll have to <strong>agree to differ</strong>. And that means accept that we have different opinions on this one! Can we have the answer to today's quiz question then, please?</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, we can. I asked: What percentage of married couples don't know exactly what their spouse earns? Is it:<br/></span><span>a) 4%?<br/></span><span>b) 14%?<br/></span><span>Or c) 44%</span></p><p><span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>And I said b) 14%.</span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And you are absolutely and completely… wrong! The correct answer is 44%. Now that's according to new research conducted by the UK credit report service, Noddle, who also found that an astonishing 1.9 million married couples actively try to keep their finances secret from their partners!</span></p><p><span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Gosh, what a lot of people! Can we have today's words again then, Neil, please?</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, we can. Here they are:<br/></span><span>go dutch<br/></span><span>spouse<br/></span><span>to be in debt<br/></span><span>mortgage<br/></span><span>hard cash<br/></span><span>cheapskate<br/></span><span>budget <br/></span><span>agree to differ</span><strong><span> </span></strong></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Well, that brings us to the end of today's 6 Minute English.

Catherine and Li talk about the programmes and debates about issues as diverse as the right of Indian women to use the toilet for free, to women who opt out of motherhood.", 19 Nov 2015,"<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript<br/><br/><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Catherine…<br/><br/><strong>Li<br/></strong>…and I'm Li. And today we are talking about women's rights. Catherine, do you think women's rights are well covered by the media?<br/><br/><strong>Catherine<br/></strong><strong>Covered</strong> means 'talked about'. And I would say it could be better, to be honest. Many women's magazines are all about beauty tips, fashion and how to please your man. Now, I'm interested in the real issues. One thing the media doesn't talk about much is what the role of childless women, like myself, is. And <strong>childless</strong> means 'having no children'.<br/><br/><strong>Li<br/></strong>Yes. In some societies, the <strong>role</strong> of women – role, the way they are expected to behave – is to have children. If they don't, it's like there's something wrong with them, and they are supposed to be unhappy.<br/><br/><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>I have no children and I'm very happy. Anyway, women in various countries around the world want to discuss problems which are close to home. And that's why the BBC has organised a series of programmes to discuss some issues that affect half the world's population. The series is called 100 Women and it's the theme of this 6 Minute English.<br/><br/><strong>Li<br/></strong>The <strong>discrimination</strong> against women happens in different ways in different countries.<br/><br/><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Discrimination means the unjust treatment of people who belong to different groups - in this case, male and female. Maybe Li, more women should be in positions of power. And that's what today's quiz question is about. Li, how many female heads of state or government do we have around the world now, in 2015? Is it: </p><p>a) 9<br/>b) 19 or<br/>c) 29</p><p><strong><span data-mce-mark=""1"">Li<br/></span></strong><span data-mce-mark=""1"">Well, I'm going to guess… c) 29. </span></p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>That's very optimistic and we'll find out later if you're right. Now, let's talk about the BBC's 100 Women season. The season will include programmes across all the BBC platforms – including radio, online, TV and social media. And the BBC's Tammi Walker is working on the social media offer. Here she is, explaining what audiences can expect.</p><p><strong><span>INSERT</span></strong><br/><strong><span>Tammi Walker, BBC social media producer for 100 Women<br/></span></strong><span>Within the season we've got big debates. One is ""Is news failing women?"", which is obviously <strong>at the core</strong> of what we are trying to get to. And that will be a live debate held in London but we're going to have people speaking in different countries about that. And we're also doing a big debate called ""What does it mean to be a good girl or an ideal woman?"". December the 1<sup>st</sup> we have three topics - leadership, relationships and image - and we're going to do three live debates on that day. And we've sent out packs to over 100 women's groups around the world, so that on the day they all get involved.</span></p><p><strong><span>Li<br/></span></strong><span>So at the core of the project 100 Women there will be live debates. By the way, the word 'core' means 'the central part of it'.</span></p><p><strong>Catherine<br/></strong>Indeed. And as you know Li, in some countries, women face some fairly basic problems… Here's <strong>Tammi Walker</strong> again. And this time, what word means, well, you know, what you do when you go to the toilet?</p><p><strong><span data-mce-mark=""1"">INSERT</span></strong><br/><strong><span data-mce-mark=""1"">Tammi Walker, BBC social media producer for 100 Women<br/></span></strong><span data-mce-mark=""1"">We are tying in with World Toilet Day, with the right to <strong>pee</strong>. For example in India, women are charged 25 rupees to go to the toilet whereas men obviously can go anywhere for free. You don't have to pay to go! </span></p><p><strong><span>Li<br/></span></strong><span>Yes. Women in India have to pay to pee – it means to urinate, to pass water – while men can go anywhere. It is a matter of public health too. </span></p><p><strong><span>Catherine<br/></span></strong><span>Most definitely. Now, this is the third BBC 100 Women season. Last time it prompted a big discussion in Iran. Let's hear what Sanam Dolatshahi has to say. She's a producer from BBC Persian. And can you understand what the word <strong>sexism</strong> means?</span></p><p><span><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Sanam Dolatshahi, producer, BBC Persian<br/></strong></span><span>Many people are familiar with other 'isms' you know – for example, racism. When you say 'racism' people know what it means in Iran. But not necessarily sexism. Many people confused it with sex. So some people were asking us: Air your programmes about sexism after the watershed, after 9 pm, you know, so that the children will not watch. </span></p><p><strong>Li<br/></strong>Sexism means to have a very strict idea of what each sex can or can't do and it is a form of prejudice.

Neil is a bit of a comedian but will he manage to make Alice laugh?", 12 Nov 2015,"<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript</p><p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Alice…</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>… and I'm Neil. OK Alice, I've got something for you here… a question…</p><p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>Yeah.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Ready? What is the Mexican version of One Direction?</p><p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>Um… No idea.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Juan Direction. Get it?</p><p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>Very good…</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/><em>Juan</em> Direction... You know?</p><p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>Yes, yes, I get it.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Never mind. Can you guess what the subject of today's show is instead?</p><p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>Is it bad jokes?</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Come on! That was a good little gag! Yes. The subject of today's show is… what makes us laugh. And in this context, to get something, for example a gag – or joke, means to understand it. We all like to laugh – well not you apparently – but most of us do! It's good for our health, it reduces stress and releases feel-good hormones in the body.</p><p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>OK, thank you, Neil. But how about answering today's quiz question? Which Greek word means the study of laughter and its effects on the body? Is it…<br/>a) risology?<br/>b) gelotology?<br/>or c) comology?</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>That's difficult and I'm going to say c) comology because it's got the word 'comedy' in it, you see?</p><p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>Oh, very good. OK. Well, we'll find out later if you're right. Now, did you know, we rarely laugh when we're on our own? Laughter is a social thing that we generally like to share with other people.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Really? I laugh when I'm watching cartoons on my own – don't you, Alice?</p><p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>No, Neil, I don't. Anyway, some researchers believe that the purpose of laughter is related to the way we bond with each other. And the more we laugh, the more we bond as a group.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Interesting idea. It could explain why stand-up comedy – where a comedian performs in front of and talks directly to their audience – is very popular entertainment. But what does it take to keep your audience laughing? Let’s listen to Steve Byrne, a successful US comedian talking about this.</p><p><strong>INSERT</strong><br/><strong>Steve Byrne, comedian</strong><br/>The one single thing an aspiring comedian should do is to write, write, write and talk about the things that make them laugh. Selfishness – time to be selfish – time to be a little narcissistic. What is it that makes you laugh? Because that will get you closer to finding your voice. Because ultimately that's why people come see you.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>So comedians need to be selfish and narcissistic – that sounds pretty negative!</p><p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>Yes, it does. Narcissistic means being too interested in yourself – for example your appearance or other personal qualities. And aspiring means wanting to be successful in your chosen career.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>And what does Steve mean when he says comedians need to find their voice?</p><p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>Well, he means they need to talk about what they think in a way that's unique – meaning unusual or special – to them.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>OK. Let's listen to Steve again talking about turning 40 and what he finds funny about that.</p><p><strong>INSERT</strong><br/><strong>Steve Byrne, comedian</strong><br/>When you turn 40 you will hear this in your life and hopefully you'll hear this the rest of your life. 'You look good for 40. You look good for 52. You look great for 63.' You never hear that when you're young. You never hear: 'You look good for 19.'<br/><br/>You think there's going to be some magic potion – some magic shortcut to it all. It's writing and getting up on stage. It takes a lot of perseverance and it's such a competitive occupation. You know, you've just got to outwork everybody.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Well, we heard Steve making his audience laugh there. And by the way, Alice, you look fantastic for 40.</p><p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>That's not funny, Neil. I'm only 39 and you know it. Anyway, moving on, Steve says there's no magic potion or shortcut to success. You have to work hard – it doesn't happen by itself. And perseverance means to keep on trying to achieve something even when it's difficult.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>He says you have to outwork everybody – which means to work harder than everybody else. Steve certainly doesn't make comedy sound much fun, does he?</p><p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>No. In fact some people say there's a connection between depression and comedy – that comedians can be introverted and depressive.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Is that right? Introverts are generally quiet people who are more interested in their own thoughts and feelings than in spending time with other people.</p><p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>Yes, you'd think that most comedians would be extroverts – people who are lively and enjoy the company of others. OK I think it's time for the answer to our quiz question, Neil. I asked: Which Greek word means the study of laughter and its effects on the body? Is it…<br/><br/>a) risology?<br/>b) gelotology?<br/>or c) comology?</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Yes. I said c) comology, which I think I'm beginning to regret now.</p><p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>Yes, well, indeed. Sorry, I'm afraid that's the wrong answer. It's actually b) gelotology – which comes from the Greek word, gelos, meaning laughter.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>OK. You can stop sniggering now, Alice and just tell us today's words once again?</p><p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>Alright then. Here they are:<br/>get something (e.g. a joke)<br/>gag<br/>stand-up comedy<br/>narcissistic<br/>aspiring<br/>unique<br/>perseverance<br/>outwork<br/>introverts<br/>extroverts</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/>Well, that just about brings us to the end of today's 6 Minute English.</p><p><strong>Alice</strong><br/>See you next time.</p><p><strong>Both</strong><br/>Bye.</p>",Transcript,"<p><strong><span>get something (idiomatic)</span></strong><strong><br/></strong><span>understand </span></p><p><strong><span>gag</span></strong><strong><br/></strong><span>joke or funny story</span></p><p><span><strong>stand-up comedy<br/></strong>a type of comedy where a comedian performs in front of and talks directly to their audience</span></p><p><strong><span>narcissistic</span></strong><br/><span>being too interested in yourself – for example your appearance or other personal qualities</span></p><p><strong><span>aspiring</span></strong><br/><span>wanting to be successful in your chosen career</span></p><p><strong><span>unique</span></strong><br/><span>unusual or special</span></p><p><strong><span>perseverance</span></strong><br/><span>to keep on trying to achieve something even when it’s difficult</span></p><p><strong><span>outwork</span></strong><br/><span>work harder than everybody else</span></p><p><strong><span>introverts</span></strong><br/><span>people who are generally quiet and more interested in their own thoughts and feelings than in spending time with other people</span></p><p><strong><span>extroverts</span></strong><br/><span>people who are generally lively, outgoing, and enjoy the company of others</span></p>",Vocabulary

Neil and Alice take a look at the environmental impact of mass-produced plastic bags and plastic in general. They also teach some related vocabulary., 05 Nov 2015,"<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript</p><p><span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Alice…</span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>… and I'm Neil. Hello.</span></p><p><span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Hello, Neil. Have you been shopping?</span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, I went a bit mad with my credit card actually. </span></p><p><span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Gosh, I can see that! But look at all those plastic bags. Why don't you use your own bags? </span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>You know what, I'm going to. Because they're now charging 5p per bag!</span></p><p><span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Don't you follow the news, Neil? It's a recent government <strong>initiative</strong> – which means a new plan for dealing with something – in this case, to cut the number of thin plastic bags being given away in shops. And the environmental impact of plastic is the subject of today's show.</span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Is England the first country to charge for these bags, Alice?</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>No – other countries in the UK started charging a few years ago. And countries around the world including Bangladesh, South Africa, China, and Italy have actually banned them altogether.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Interesting. But I don't throw my bags away, Alice. I put them under the kitchen sink. </span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Are you a <strong>hoarder</strong>, Neil? That means someone who collects large amounts of stuff and can't throw things away.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Maybe I am… But seriously, with the 5p charge I'm definitely going to recycle my plastic bags. </span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Good. Now let me ask you today's quiz question, Neil: How many tonnes of plastic rubbish from the UK is being sent to China each year for recycling? Is it:<br/></span><span>a) 20,000?<br/></span><span>b) 200,000?<br/></span><span>or c) 2,000,000?</span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well I think it's … a) 20,000. </span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>We'll find out if you're right or wrong later on. But first, why are plastic bags bad for the environment?</span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Because they're too thin? And when they break all your shopping falls out? That must be it.</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>No. They take hundreds of years to <strong>decompose</strong> – or break down by natural chemical processes. And also people don't dispose of them properly. They litter our streets. They <strong>clog </strong>– or block – drains and sewers. They spoil the countryside and damage wildlife.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well that's quite a list. So what's the solution then, Alice?</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Well to either recycle or stop using plastic bags. But let's hear about the pharmaceutical company with another idea. This is BBC reporter John Maguire.</span></p><p><span><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>John Maguire, BBC reporter<br/></strong></span><span>At this company laboratory in North London they're testing how bags made with a special additive break down when exposed to sunlight, oxygen and heat… The technology was discovered by a British scientist in the 1970s and is now sold to around half the world's countries. In some, biodegradable bags are backed by law. </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And <strong>biodegradable</strong> means able to break down naturally in a way that isn't harmful to the environment.</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>So adding small amounts of a chemical to the plastic – a special <strong>additive</strong> – allows the plastic to break down in the open air. But if the technology was discovered back in the 1970s, why aren't these biodegradable bags being used in <em>every</em> country by now?</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>I have no idea, Alice. Maybe they aren't as strong as non-biodegradable bags. I like a good strong bag, myself, you see.</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Alright. Well, just go and buy yourself some canvas bags, Neil! In fact, I'll get you some for your birthday. </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Thank you.</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>You're very welcome. Now, moving on. Out of around 300 million tons of plastic produced every year, some goes in <strong>landfill</strong> – a place where our rubbish is buried under the earth – but about 10% of plastic ends up in the sea. Let's listen to Biologist Dr Pennie Lindeque from Plymouth Marine Laboratory talking about this.</span></p><p><span><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Biologist Dr Pennie Lindeque from Plymouth Marine Laboratory<br/></strong></span><span>We're already finding that there's a lot of microplastics in the sea and that some of these microplastics are actually being ingested by the zooplankton that live there. We're also concerned this could end up being passed up through the food chain to food which is destined for human consumption so it could end up on your or my plate.</span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>What are <strong>microplastics</strong>, Alice?</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice</span></strong><br/><span>They're small plastic fragments less than 5mm in size. You find them in cosmetic products such as facial scrubs, shower gel, and toothpaste. </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil</span></strong><br/><span>And I'm guessing that <strong>ingested</strong> means 'eaten'? </span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, the <strong>zooplankton</strong> – tiny little animals in the sea – mistake the microplastics for food and eat them. And because the zooplankton and humans are in the same food chain – they're at the bottom and we're at the top – but we're still connected – we may end up eating them and the microplastics inside them!</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>That doesn't sound very tasty! Now a <strong>food chain</strong>, by the way, refers to a series of living things where each creature feeds on the one below it in the chain.</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Indeed. OK. Remember my question from earlier? I asked: How many tonnes of plastic rubbish from the UK is being sent to China each year for recycling? Is it…<br/></span><span>a) 20,000?<br/></span><span>b) 200,000?<br/></span><span>or c) 2,000,000?</span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I said a) 20,000.</span></p><p><span><strong>Alice<br/></strong>Yes but you're wrong, I'm afraid. The answer is b) 200,000 tonnes. And that statistic comes from the University of Cambridge in the UK. </span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>That's a load of rubbish! Get it – load of rubbish?</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>Very good.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Can we hear today's words again please?</span></p><p><strong><span>Alice<br/></span></strong><span>We certainly can.

They are small apes that live in South East Asia. When they communicate with each other they sound like they are singing – and some sing in duets – but why?, 30 Jul 2015,"<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript</p><p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Rob…</span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And hello! I'm Neil.</span></p><p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Hi there Neil. Have you ever had a close encounter with a monkey or an ape?  </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well I’m sitting right next to you, Rob?</span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Very funny. Neil is referring to the fact that all humans are descended from apes, and apes and monkeys belong to a group of animals called <strong>primates</strong>.  The difference is that monkeys have tails, and apes don’t.  </span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, I didn’t know that. On a serious note… I had <strong>a close shave</strong> with some monkeys once in Bali.</span></p><p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>A close shave is where you only just manage to avoid a dangerous situation. So Neil, what happened?</span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I was walking up a mountain on my own and suddenly a bunch of monkeys jumped out of nowhere, blocking my path.</span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Oh goodness! OK. So what did you do?</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>After standing there for ages while the monkeys screeched at me, I turned round and walked back the way I came.</span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>OK. If you <strong>screech</strong> at someone it means to make a loud, high and unpleasant sound. So the monkeys won that <strong>face-off</strong>, then!</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Absolutely! Yes, they did! And a face-off, by the way, means an argument or fight.</span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Well, today’s show is about gibbons and the different sounds they make. <strong>Gibbons</strong> are small apes that live in Southeast Asia. And while Neil’s monkeys screech unpleasantly, gibbons sound like they are singing.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Musical apes – that’s nice! So how about today’s quiz question, Rob?</span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>OK, good idea. How far can a gibbon’s voice travel through the forest? Is it…</span></p><p><span>a) 500m</span></p><p><span>b) 1km</span></p><p><span>or c) 5km?</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Hmm. Well, I have to guess and I’m going to say b) 1km.</span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>You’ve never heard one.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Never heard one…</span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>OK. We’ll find out later on in the programme whether you’re right or wrong. Now let’s listen to what a gibbon really sounds like.</span></p><p><span><strong>Interview with Dr Esther Clarke, researcher at Durham University <br/></strong></span><span><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Let’s just hear this. [gibbons calling] That’s an absolutely wonderful, evocative sound, isn’t it? Beautiful sound. And what are they doing there then? That is … I said talking to each other. </span></p><p><span><strong>Dr Clarke:</strong> Well this is their… They’re singing together. So a male and a female, when they hold a territory together, will sing every morning what they call a duet. All the groups…</span></p><p><span><strong>Interviewer:</strong> What we call a duet.</span></p><p><span><strong>Dr Clarke:</strong> Yes, absolutely. And they’ll all sing together at the same time, and the whole forest will be alive with this cacophony of song.</span></p><p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong></span><span>So the gibbons make an <strong>evocative</strong> sound. If something is evocative it brings strong feelings or memories to mind.</span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And something that is evocative is usually pleasant, Rob.</span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>It is. And what’s also interesting is that the apes are singing in pairs – one male and one female. They are singing <strong>duets</strong> together. So a duet is a song sung by two people – or in this case, sung by two gibbons!</span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And a lot of gibbons are singing duets at the same time – which Dr Clarke describes as a <strong>cacophony</strong>. Cacophony means a mix of loud noises, which often sound out of tune.</span></p><p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And that could easily describe us singing together! </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Let’s not do that.</span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>But what’s the reason for the gibbon duets, Neil?</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, the songs advertise the relationship between the male and the female. And they also help to make clear which <strong>territory</strong> – or bit of land – belongs to a pair or group of gibbons.</span></p><p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Gibbons also use different sounds to <strong>alert</strong> – or warn – other gibbons about danger from <strong>predators</strong> – these are animals that eat other animals. The gibbons use a quiet ‘hoo hoo’ call to communicate that a leopard is nearby, and an even quieter ‘hoo hoo’ call for an eagle.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>You’re very good at that Rob. </span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Thank you.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Now let’s hear more from Dr Clarke about this. How does she describe language?</span></p><p><strong><span>Dr Esther Clarke, researcher at Durham University</span></strong><br/><span>Yes, so the idea is that if we find things like context-specific calling in non-human primates, it suggests that way back in time the ancestor that we shared with them also had context-specific calling so basically it just gives us some clues [as] to the evolutionary roots of complex communication like language. </span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Dr Clarke says that if we go far enough back in time humans and other primates such as monkeys and apes have the same <strong>ancestor</strong>. </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Right. And ancestor means an animal – or human – from the past that a modern animal or human has descended from. So if this common ancestor used <strong>context-specific</strong> calls like modern gibbons – then it could have passed on this ability to humans a long time ago.</span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Context-specific calling means different calls for different situations, for example one call for ‘leopard’ and another for ‘eagle’.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And <strong>evolutionary</strong> means a gradual process of change or development.</span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>OK, let’s have the answer to the quiz question. Earlier I asked: How far can a gibbon’s voice travel through the forest? Is it: a) 500m b) 1km or c) 5km?</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And I said b) 1km. </span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>And you were right! A good guess! Perhaps you do know a lot about gibbons. So well done! Now, can we hear today’s words again maybe in a gibbon's voice Neil?</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>I’m not sure about that. I’ll do it in a human voice. </span></p><p><span>primates</span></p><p><span>a close shave</span></p><p><span>screech</span></p><p><span>face-off</span></p><p><span>gibbons</span></p><p><span>evocative</span></p><p><span>duet</span></p><p><span>cacophony</span></p><p><span>territory </span></p><p><span>alert</span></p><p><span>predators</span></p><p><span>ancestor</span></p><p><span>evolutionary</span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Thank you.

Welcome to 6 Minute English. With me today is Neil. Hello, Neil.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Hello Rob!</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>In this programme we're going to be talking about endangered species, particularly elephants in China. So let's start with a question, Neil. Do you know how many elephants are still living in the wild in China? Is it:</p><p>a)    Fewer than 15,000</p><p>b)    Fewer than 1,000</p><p>c)    Fewer than 300</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I don't know but I'm going to have a guess and say b) fewer than 1,000.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>I'll let you know if you're right or wrong at the end of the programme.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So Rob, have you ever come across any animal species under threat?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes, I have, I went to Australia a few years ago and saw some turtles on the beach laying their eggs and they're very rare, aren't they?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>They are very rare. I've always wanted to see them but I haven't had the chance.  I was lucky enough to see a panda when I was in China once and they're threatened with extinction, too, of course.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>The sad thing is, Neil, these animals are in danger largely because of the activities of human beings. There are all sorts of reasons why this is happening. </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, it's really upsetting. And it could easily be prevented if people thought a bit harder about the impact their lives make on wild animals. Take those sea turtles you were talking about, for instance. They're under threat for all sorts of reasons, over-fishing being one of them.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Then there are various species of rhinoceros which could disappear in a few years' time. Again, people <strong>poach</strong> these creatures – poach means hunt illegally - because their horns are used for medicinal purposes. And, of course, in country areas, miles from civilisation, it's almost impossible to keep a check on illegal killings.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>It really makes you think, doesn't it Rob?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Actually, it's not that simple, Neil. Human beings are also under pressure and often have strong arguments in favour of their actions. This Chinese farmer explains. He uses an expression that means ""arrived"". Can you tell me what it is?  </p><p><strong>Chinese farmer <br/></strong>There are too many elephants around here. We used to grow sugar cane but then the elephants started showing up and ate it all. So we gave up growing it. There was barely anything we could grow. No matter what we planted there was nothing to harvest …. Now we grow rubber. It's the only thing they won't eat.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>He said ""showing up"". This means the elephants arrived.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And he said they ""gave up"" growing it. This means they stopped growing it.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>The plight of the Asian elephant in China makes a pretty bleak picture, I must say. I understand that they are victims of all sorts of abuse.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes, experts say their numbers have declined by 50 per cent in the last 75 years. Poaching is one reason why. They are hunted not for their tusks – that happens to the larger African elephant – but for their skins to make leather goods and for their meat.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>They are also losing their <strong>habitats</strong> – that's the places where they live - because of the growth in the number of plantations, particularly rubber, but also other cash crops. These agricultural monocultures, as they are called, spell death for the elephants' lifestyle. Logging or deforestation – in which whole forests are destroyed - also adds to their problems.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>What's more, in some places, their migratory routes have been cut off by human populations living in newly established villages. In a more general sense, just expanding human population is forcing them out of their natural environments.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>There's another very unpleasant way in which these creatures are suffering, Rob. Many of the young elephants are taken away from the herd and are turned into performing circus animals for tourists.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Really, Neil?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, I hear that sometimes nails are driven into their feet, they are deprived of sleep, food and water. This is to make them easy to train.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>That's so cruel.  But there are people trying to improve the situation, Neil. For example, there's a <strong>rehabilitation programme</strong> – that's a scheme to bring them back to a normal life - which rescues elephants at risk and give them protection within a special sanctuary. Then there are some people who are trying to get people to get farmers to work in a different way. Let's listen to a forestry policeman. He uses an expression to describe the way people farm the land. Can you tell me what it is?     </p><p><strong>Forestry police representative</strong><br/>It makes me sad. I want people to know that they shouldn't cut down the forest and that there are consequences if they do. I want them to change their farming practices, to change how they make a living. We could become a tourist destination. People could make money from that.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>He said ""farming practices"". This means the way people farm the land.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And he said ""make a living"". This refers to people earning enough money in order to survive.

Welcome to 6 Minute English. With me today is Neil. Hello, Neil.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>Hello Rob!</p><p><strong> Rob<br/> </strong>In this programme we're going to be talking about coffee.</p><p><strong> Neil<br/> </strong>Coffee? I've actually got one here in front of me, Rob.</p><p><strong> Rob</strong><br/> What kind of coffee are you drinking?</p><p><strong> Neil</strong><br/> It's a skinny latte. And what's that that you've got?</p><p><strong> Rob</strong><br/> I've gone for a flat white today. (Sound of sipping) Mmm. That tastes good.</p><p><strong> Neil</strong><br/> Looks good too! The market for the world's most popular drink has come a long way since the days of instant coffee, when we just added boiling water to some brown powder.</p><p><strong> Rob</strong><br/> Yes, that's very true, Neil. After that came the giants like Starbucks and Costa Coffee who made coffee drinking trendy and a lifestyle statement. People are far more aware of what they're drinking these days.</p><p><strong> Neil</strong><br/> But Rob, I don't think we should forget what lies behind the coffee we enjoy every day. It's a hugely complicated business.</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/> Yes, it's the second biggest commodity in the world, after oil. That means the price of coffee is changing every day, every hour even, as traders speculate about the price.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/> It means farmers in countries like Ethiopia, Costa Rica and Brazil are dependent on the deals that are made in commodity markets thousands of miles from their farms. It makes them extremely vulnerable.</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/> Let's listen to food journalist Sheila Dillon as she explains the impact of coffee markets on local growers. She uses an expression that means ""has a big effect"". Can you tell me what it is?</p><p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Sheila Dillon, Food Journalist<br/></strong>What happens in the coffee markets <strong>makes waves</strong> around the globe. Entire national economies depend on the price of coffee. It's the key to whether individual farmers can <strong>provide for</strong> their families, face unemployment and ultimately whether whole communities stay on the land or trek to the cities.</p><p><strong> Neil</strong><br/> She said ""makes waves"". This means ""have a big effect"".</p><p><strong> Rob</strong><br/> She also used the expression ""provide for"" their families. This means the farmer's family have enough income to live comfortably. Good. Right. So what about our quiz question today? Neil do you know many cups of coffee are drunk worldwide each year? Is it:</p><p>a)           38 billion</p><p>b)          400 billion</p><p>c)           950 billion</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/> Well, it's going to be a huge number, of course. But I still think I'll go for the lowest figure, which is 38 billion.</p><p><strong> Rob</strong><br/> Well, we'll see if you got the right answer at the end of the programme.</p><p><strong> Neil</strong><br/> Now, the price of coffee has soared – that means gone up quickly – in recent years, Rob. Surely that's good for everyone involved in the business? I believe the profit margins for coffee are among the highest in the world. I can't see what all the fuss is about.</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/> Well, Neil, just because the price is high, it doesn't mean that everyone benefits. It all depends on how the profits are distributed. You see there are countless transactions between the grower and the drinker. A grower can have a really good crop, but the amount he makes stays the same – or can even fall.</p><p><strong> Neil</strong><br/> Mmm, I see the problem. I expect most of the profits go to the commodity traders and very little to the individual growers of the bean. It sounds like the growers have no control. That's what happens in other agricultural sectors.</p><p><strong> Rob<br/> </strong>I'm afraid so. Of course, some people are trying to distribute the profits more widely and they have been having some success.</p><p><strong> Neil</strong><br/> Yes, I heard about some small-scale projects where the company takes charge of the whole process from field to shop.</p><p><strong> Rob</strong><br/> Yes, these organisations tend to farm organically. This is very <strong>labour intensive</strong> – that means a lot of people are employed – and it creates a lot of jobs for people within the local community. In this way they are not victims of market fluctuations. Let's listen to Leo Virmani, who runs a small plantation like this in Costa Rica. What's the verb he uses for putting the coffee in a box before selling it?</p><p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong>Leo Virmani, Coffee producer<br/></strong>For our plantation, the approach we have is to go through every step of the way - every step of the process - so that we grow it, we pick it, and we process it in the mill. Then eventually we'll roast it, we'll <strong>package</strong> it, and we'll sell it as the small plantation we are. And that would allow us to stay or be <strong>profitable</strong> at the end of the day.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br/> So, he used the verb ""package"", which means ""put a product in a packet or box before selling"" it. </p><p><strong> Rob</strong><br/> And he said his community can stay ""profitable"" – this means they can always maintain profits – or make money.</p><p><strong> Neil<br/> </strong>Well, it's good to know that small growers can live reasonably comfortably despite what the world markets are doing. The next time I grab a takeaway coffee I'll try to remember all the politics involved in the production process.</p><p><strong> Rob<br/> </strong>Yes, me too. So, shall we have the answer to the quiz question now?</p><p><strong> Neil</strong><br/> Yes. You asked me how many cups of coffee are drunk worldwide each year – 38 billion, 400 billion or 950 billion. And I guessed 38 billion.</p><p><strong> Rob<br/> </strong>I'm afraid you're wrong – the answer is actually 400 billion.</p><p><strong> Neil<br/> </strong>No way.That's incredible.</p><p><strong> Rob</strong><br/> Yes, it's an extraordinary statistic. Well, we're almost out of time. So, let's remind ourselves of some of the words we've said today, Neil.</p><p><strong> Neil<br/></strong>commodity</p><p>speculate</p><p>fluctuations</p><p>vulnerable</p><p>make waves</p><p>provides for</p><p>labour intensive</p><p>package</p><p>profitable</p><p><strong>Rob</strong><br/> Well, that's it for today.

It warms our planet and gives us light – and astronomers have been fascinated with it for hundreds of years., 09 Apr 2015,,Transcript,"<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript</p><p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Rob…</span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>… and I'm Neil. Hello.</span></p><p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Hello, Neil, and what a glorious sunny day it is today. Not a cloud in the sky! Spring is definitely here! Now, Neil, you’re a bit of a sun worshipper, aren’t you? You like sunbathing…</span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I do indeed! I love sitting in my deckchair in the garden, catching some rays…</span></p><p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Hmm, yes, you look a bit orange actually. Are you sure that tan's not fake? </span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong></span><span>Very cheeky, Rob, very cheeky…</span></p><p><strong><span>Rob</span></strong><br/><span>Now the reason I mentioned sunbathing is because we’re discussing the sun in this programme.</span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, that’s right. The sun is our nearest star – although it’s a staggering 150 million kilometres away. Earth is one of nine planets that <strong>orbit</strong> – or circle around – the sun. And life on Earth couldn’t exist without its warmth and light.</span></p><p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And we should mention… the sun is absolutely <strong>massive</strong>. Its volume is so large you could fit a million Earths inside it.</span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>That’s amazing! It’s also incredibly hot. Hotter than anything you could imagine. </span></p><p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>So Neil, can you answer this question: How hot is the surface of the sun? Now I’ll help you out by telling you that the sun’s <strong>core</strong> – that’s the centre – is a blistering five million degrees Celsius. But how hot is the sun’s surface? Is it ...</span></p><p><span>a) 1.5 billion degrees Celsius</span></p><p><span>b) 1.5 million degrees Celsius</span></p><p><span>or c) 5500 degrees Celsius</span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Hmm. I have no idea. They all sound quite warm to me. But … I think it must be a bit cooler than the core. So I’m going to go for 1.5 million degrees.</span></p><p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Okay. Well, we'll find out if you're right or wrong later on. But now let’s listen to Professor of Solar Physics Louise Harra to discover what the sun is made of.</span></p><p><strong><span>Louise Harra, Professor of Solar Physics at UCL Mullard Space Science<br/></span></strong><span>It’s just a big ball of gas. And we measure it… it’s made mostly of hydrogen. So it’s roughly 90% hydrogen, it’s maybe 8% helium, and the rest of it’s made up of things like iron, carbon, oxygen, nickel.</span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So the main gas is hydrogen, which accounts for 90% of the sun’s <strong>matter</strong>. Now, 'matter' means what something is made of.</span></p><p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And hydrogen creates all the sun’s <strong>energy</strong>. Heat and light energy is created all the time in the sun’s core as a result of gas explosions or nuclear reactions. And this bit is hard to believe – it takes a hundred thousand years for this light energy to travel from the sun’s core to the sun’s surface. </span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>But once it reaches the sun’s surface – the <strong>photosphere</strong> – it can escape. In fact, it takes only eight minutes for light energy from the sun to reach the Earth. Scientists these days are able to see the photosphere in fantastic detail using powerful telescopes.  </span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Though Galileo observed dark spots on the sun through his telescope several hundred years ago, didn’t he? Which brings us on to another question: How old is the sun? </span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, I happen to know that it came into being around four and a half billion years ago. </span></p><p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Did you study solar physics at university, Neil? </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>No, just… you know, just general knowledge.</span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Well, the sun <strong>came into being</strong> – or was created – a very long time ago! We’re going to hear now from Professor of Physics, Yvonne Elseworth. What does she say about how long the sun is going to stay the same?</span></p><p><span><strong>Yvonne Elseworth, Poynting Professor of Physics at the University of Birmingham<br/></strong>In terms of its current lifestyle it’s here for as long again, so we’re about half way through. And then it becomes a different sort of star – it becomes a giant star and that’s probably curtains for us, actually. It’ll get a bit warm, a bit toasty, and we’ll get enveloped in the sun, and it won’t be nice...</span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So the sun is going to stay the same for another four and a half billion years. But the professor also says that the sun will change. When it becomes a giant star, it will be <strong>curtains</strong> for our planet – and ‘curtains’ means the end, I’m afraid!</span></p><p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes, it does. And as a giant star, the sun will get hotter – it will make the Earth <strong>toasty</strong>. Now, toasty usually means hot in a nice way.</span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>That’s right – for example, my toes are warm and toasty in my new slippers. But in reality the giant sun will make the Earth unbearably hot. It will surround – or <strong>envelop</strong> – our planet and burn it up.  </span></p><p><strong><span>Rob</span></strong><br/><span>Well, I’m glad we’re not going to be around when that happens. Now, remember at the beginning of the show I asked you how hot the sun’s surface is? Is it a) 1.5 billion b) 1.5 million or c) 5500 degrees Celsius?</span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I said 1.5 million…</span></p><p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>It’s way too hot, I’m afraid you were wrong. The answer is actually 5500 degrees Celsius. But still, if you’re planning on visiting the sun, remember to take your sunglasses and plenty of sunscreen! Now, before we go, it’s time to remind ourselves of some of the vocabulary that we’ve heard today.

The technique is designed to stop genetic diseases being passed from mother to child. Neil and Harry talk about this controversial proposal. Listen to their conversation and learn some new vocabulary., 02 Apr 2015,,Transcript,"<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript</p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Hello. Welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Neil and with me in the studio today is Harry. </span></p><p><strong><span>Harry<br/></span></strong><span>Hello!</span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>We all have two biological parents but in the future if someone from the UK tells you they have three parents, it might be true. </span></p><p><span><strong>Harry<br/></strong>That's right. This is because the UK has become the first country to approve laws allowing the creation of babies with <strong>DNA</strong> from three people! DNA is the chemical structure present in the centre of a cell which defines somebody's characteristics. This is to fight a particular disease.</span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes. Sometimes parts of the DNA called <strong>genes</strong> are <strong>faulty</strong>; it means they don't work properly and this might cause problems later on. A new technique will allow some of these genes to be replaced by healthy ones from a third person. </span></p><p><strong><span>Harry</span></strong><span> <br/>This practice is controversial – people argue about it. They fear we're going to mess with nature and end up with a Frankenstein's monster!</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Wow, that would be frightening, let's hope it doesn't happen! Well, in this programme we're talking about the three-parent baby and you're going to learn some vocabulary related to reproduction.</span></p><p><strong><span>Harry<br/></span></strong><span><strong>Genetics</strong> – the science of how living creatures pass their characteristics to their offspring – is fascinating, Neil! </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>It is fascinating, and you know what I find most surprising, Harry? It's how much DNA we have in common with other living creatures.</span></p><p><strong><span>Harry<br/></span></strong><span>I've heard that a very high percentage of our DNA is similar to the DNA of monkeys. </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>The comparison with monkeys is easy. Over 95% of our DNA is identical to theirs. But what you might not know is… how much of our DNA is similar to the DNA in a banana?</span></p><p><strong><span>Harry<br/></span></strong><span>A banana?!</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yes. And that's my quiz question today. What percentage of our DNA is similar to that of a banana? Is it:</span></p><p><span>a)</span>    <span>About 1%</span></p><p><span>b)</span>    <span>About 20% or</span></p><p><span>c)</span>    <span>About 50%</span></p><p><strong><span>Harry<br/></span></strong><span>I think we have very little in common with bananas so I'm gonna go for 1%. </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, I'll give you the correct answer at the end of the programme. Now let's talk about the three-parent baby. A <strong>pioneering</strong> technique, in other words, a technique never used before, has been developed by scientists in Newcastle University here in the UK. The technique helps people with faulty <strong>mitochondria</strong>, which are structures that work like energy factories in our cells. The mitochondria are like batteries.</span></p><p><strong><span>Harry<br/></span></strong><span>And what kind of problems do people who inherit faulty mitochondria have?</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>They have serious health problems such as brain damage and heart failure. </span></p><p><strong><span>Harry<br/></span></strong><span>That's terrible! Maybe it would be good to have this technique approved.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, not everybody agrees with it. Fiona Bruce, who is a Member of Parliament here in Britain, expressed concern when the proposal was discussed in Parliament. Listen out for the expression she uses right at the beginning of her speech. It means that when you start something, you can't take it back.</span></p><p><span><strong>Fiona Bruce MP<br/></strong>Once <strong>the genie is out of the bottle</strong>, once these procedures that we are being asked to authorise today go ahead, there will be no going back for society. </span></p><p><strong><span>Harry<br/></span></strong><span>She says that <strong>the genie is out of the bottle</strong>. It's an expression to do with fairy tales – in particular, the story of Aladdin, when he rubs a lamp and a genie appears. When the genie is released, anything is possible – even bad things. And there's nothing anyone can do to stop it.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>So in the case of DNA engineering, people are afraid that similar techniques might be used to create <strong>designer babies</strong> – babies whose characteristics like height, sex, hair and eye colour are created to order. Or we might be looking at babies with several parents - and who knows where it might end.</span></p><p><strong><span>Harry<br/></span></strong><span>But the approval of this proposal has also made many people happy,</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, people like Victoria, a mother who has a sick child because of faulty mitochondria. She uses an expression which means 'amazing or astonishing'. Which expression is it?</span></p><p><strong><span>Victoria Holliday, mother who will benefit from the new technique<br/></span></strong><span>It's just <strong>mind-boggling</strong> what this could mean for our family and for other families who are affected. It's just the best news!</span></p><p><strong><span>Harry<br/></span></strong><span>She uses the expression 'mind-boggling', in other words something astonishing, overwhelming. That's great news for this lady. I'm happy for her.</span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, it is. According to statistics faulty mitochondria affects one in every 6,500 babies - a considerable number of people. Well, this is an interesting subject but we're running out of time and…</span></p><p><strong><span>Harry<br/></span></strong><span>… and you're going to tell me what percentage of DNA we have in common with a banana, aren't you? </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>I am. And the options I gave you were about 1%, 20% or 50%. And you said…</span></p><p><span><strong>Harry<br/></strong>I said I thought it was just 1%. </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, can you believe that it's 50%? We are half… half and half like bananas.</span></p><p><strong><span>Harry<br/></span></strong><span>That's incredible! They're not even mammals, we are so different to them … It's mind-boggling! </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Let's listen to today's words once again, Harry.</span></p><p><span><strong>Harry<br/></strong>Yes.

I'm Neil…</p><p><strong>Harry<br/></strong>And I'm Harry.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Now Harry, have you ever taken a '<strong>selfie</strong>' – that's a photo of yourself, usually with your mobile phone?</p><p><strong>Harry<br/></strong>Yes, I have. I've taken them all over London with my children – of course selfies are very easy to take with your smartphone and recently we've seen some famous selfies featuring well-known people such as the one taken by actor, Ellen DeGeneres at last year's Oscars ceremony.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, it seems that there are no limits to the places where you can <strong>capture</strong> yourself in a photo. But there is a limit on how far you can stretch your arm out and take <strong>a snap</strong> – a quick photo – of you and your friends.</p><p><strong>Harry<br/></strong>That's true, so thank goodness for the <strong>selfie stick</strong> – an expanding pole to put your smartphone on which gives you a wider view. This means you can take in more of the background. Sounds like a good idea.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>It does, but it's also causing a problem in some places around the world. More on that in a moment but let's not forget I have a question to ask you Harry.</p><p><strong>Harry<br/></strong>OK Neil.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, we know some people love to take photos of themselves but perhaps not as much as Patrick Peterson. According to Guinness World Records he has taken the most 'selfies' in one hour – but do you know how many? Is it:</p><p>a)    449</p><p>b)    1,449</p><p>c)    2,449</p><p><strong>Harry<br/></strong>Well, I guess he's gotta move and be in a different position so I'm not going to go for the highest one. I'm gonna say1,449.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>OK, well, we'll find out the answer at the end of the programme. But now let's talk more about the dangers of the selfie stick! They can certainly be useful for taking photos from a different <strong>viewpoint</strong> and it does mean that you get more people in your photo.</p><p><strong>Harry<br/></strong>Sales of the selfie stick have <strong>soared</strong> – or risen quickly - since last year and they are now a common sight at tourist destinations. They're great if you want to take a better photo but they're very annoying if you're not involved with the photo.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes and this is particularly frustrating if you're trying to look at paintings and sculptures at an art gallery. They just get in the way and can be very <strong>distracting</strong>.</p><p><strong>Harry<br/></strong>You mean they stop someone giving their full attention to what they are looking at. Well, this is the reason that some famous art galleries around the world are putting <strong>a ban</strong> on selfie-sticks – a ban means they are no longer allowed.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Places such as the Smithsonian museums in Washington and the Palace of Versailles in Paris were the first to do this and now the National Gallery in London have stopped them being used.</p><p><strong>Harry<br/></strong>Let's hear the exact reasons why from the gallery's Doctor Susan Foister. What phrase does she use to mean trying to do the best thing for the visitors and for the paintings themselves?</p><p><strong>Doctor Susan Foister, Deputy Director, The National Gallery<br/></strong>We have over 6 million visitors a year here, some of our rooms could get quite crowded, so we have to find the right balance between the experience of our visitors close to the paintings and the safety of the paintings themselves.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So the National Gallery is a popular and busy place and it gets quite crowded – and it doesn't help the problem if people are holding up selfie sticks!</p><p><strong>Harry<br/></strong>Yes – so they have <strong>imposed</strong> – or brought in – this ban to do the best thing for the visitors and for the paintings themselves – it's what Doctor Foister called 'the right balance'. She wants to give visitors trying to get close to the paintings a good experience.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And she makes the point that there's a risk that the painting, which can be worth millions of pounds, could be damaged by one of these sticks.</p><p><strong>Harry<br/></strong>Of course you are still allowed to take a selfie, and some museums are <strong>'sticking their neck out'</strong> and still allowing people to use them.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>A good idiom there Harry – you mean they're doing something that other people may not like – yes, places such as the ICA – that's the Institute for Contemporary Art – in London say selfie sticks are part of modern-day life.</p><p><strong>Harry<br/></strong>Here is Catherine Stout, Head of Programmes at the ICA. How does she describe the type of visitors who go to her gallery?</p><p><strong>Catherine Stout, Head of Programmes, ICA<br/></strong>We are very happy for our visitors to take their own photographs for personal use, of course we always secure the artist's permission, but actually because we have a very young audience they're completely engaged with social media, they want to use that forum to connect with each other, to share their experiences, if they wish to use a stick they're very welcome to do so as long as, obviously, the artwork is not damaged in any way.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So the people who visit that gallery are young and use social media a lot – they are '<strong>engaged</strong>' with it and they like to share their experiences. This means taking photos on their smartphones and if they want to use a selfie stick?</p><p><strong>Harry<br/></strong>… then they are 'welcome to do so'. Just watch out where you stick it! I suppose, as long as you respect other visitors and don't get in the way, then it's ok to use one.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well I'm not so sure. Anyway, it's time to reveal the answer to the question I asked you earlier.</p><p><strong>Harry<br/></strong>Yes, this was about Patrick Peterson, who holds the record for taking the most selfies in one hour. You asked me if he took 449, 1,449 or 2,449 in one hour.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And you said 1,449, which was … the correct answer! I wonder what he did with all those images…</p><p><strong>Harry<br/></strong>He probably put them on social media.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well we need to 'stick' to our six minutes of English but just before we run out of time, could you remind us of some of the vocabulary we've used today Harry?</p><p><strong>Harry<br/></strong>Yes. We had…</p><p>selfie</p><p>capture</p><p>a snap</p><p>selfie stick</p><p>viewpoint</p><p>soared</p><p>distracting</p><p>a ban</p><p>imposed</p><p>sticking their neck out</p><p>engaged</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Thank you.

Listen to Neil and Harry’s conversation and learn some new vocabulary.", 19 Mar 2015,,Transcript,"<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Hello, welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Neil and with me in the studio is Harry. Hello, Harry.</p><p><strong>Harry<br/></strong>Hello.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Now, Harry, do you have many passwords?</p><p><strong>Harry<br/></strong><strong>Passwords</strong> - you mean the set of words and numbers which I keep secret and allow me to access information? Yes, I do actually. I've got a few for my computer and the different websites I use, and then there are my cards – credit card, debit card. And there's one for my ID here at the BBC and then there is…</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>OK. I get the idea. There are too many, aren't there?</p><p><strong>Harry<br/></strong>Oh, yes! Sometimes I struggle to remember them all. And we are advised to learn them<strong> by heart</strong>, in other words, to have them memorised and not written down.  </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>It's for security reasons. If you write them down and lose the paper you wrote them on, then they won't be secret anymore, will they? Now, how would you like to have access to things with no need for passwords or cards? </p><p><strong>Harry<br/></strong>Yeah, that would be brilliant!</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>In this programme, I'm going to tell you about a futuristic commercial building in Stockholm, Sweden, where you don't have to remember any passwords, you don't have to carry ID cards and in some cases, you don't even need to carry money to pay for your coffee.</p><p><strong>Harry<br/></strong>How does it all work then - by magic?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>No, by inserting a <strong>microchip</strong> under the skin of your hand! A microchip is a very small device with an electronic circuit which can do particular things. In this case, the microchip we're talking about can identify you.</p><p><strong>Harry<br/></strong>Wow! I'm not sure I'd want a microchip inserted under my skin.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>No, me neither. It's interesting though, isn't it? Before I tell you about this experiment, let's go for our quiz question. And, of course, it's about passwords.  Security firm SplashData publishes an annual report about the weakest passwords people use. Well, which was the most common password used in 2014. Was it:</p><p>a)    abc123</p><p>b)    the numbers 123456</p><p>c)    the words 'trustno' followed by the number 1</p><p><strong>Harry<br/></strong>I'm going to go for C, 'trustno' followed by the 1, because actually it's the only one I hadn't heard of, even though it's very obvious.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, all will be revealed at the end of the programme. Now we are talking about the increasing need for ID in a society which works more and more with computers - and you'll learn some related vocabulary.</p><p><strong>Harry<br/></strong>Tell us more about this building in Sweden, Neil. You have this microchip put under your skin - and what does it allow you to do inside the building?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Let's listen to the BBC technology reporter Rory Cellan-Jones. He went there for a visit. He uses an expression to say that the technology is not working perfectly yet because it is brand new. What is that expression?</p><p><strong>Rory Cellan-Jones, BBC technology reporter<br/></strong>The new offices will soon host a shifting population of 700 entrepreneurs and employees and they'll all be offered the chance to 'get chipped' if they wish. As well as opening doors that will allow them to use the photocopiers and eventually to log on to computers or pay for food in the cafe. The technology is still <strong>having</strong> <strong>teething problems</strong> – I found it quite a struggle to activate the photocopier! And amongst the people working here I found some enthusiasm but also <strong>caution</strong>.</p><p><strong>Harry<br/></strong>The expression is 'having teething problems'. When a new project or device doesn't work perfectly we say it 'has teething problems'.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, the microchip allowed Rory to make the photocopier work just by swiping his hand over a console. But it didn't work straight away.</p><p><strong>Harry<br/></strong>And he tells us that some of the workers are reacting with <strong>caution</strong> to the idea of having a microchip put under their skin. 'Caution' means being careful to avoid something dangerous or risky.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>It might be risky but we might all be using it one day - who knows? The group running this scheme thinks this might be a good thing. Hannes Sjobland from a Swedish bio-hacking group seems to believe that linking biology and electronic devices can make our daily lives better - but he is concerned about people's freedom. And what if a government or a big corporation wants to use this technology in the future? What does Hannes Sjobland want to be able to do if it happens? A tip, the word is a verb…</p><p><strong>Hannes Sjoband, Swedish bio-hacking group<br/></strong>We are early adopters of this technology, we experiment with it, we learn it, how it works, because I think that there might be a day when the taxman or the big corporates … they will come and say 'hey, try this chip, try this implant', and then we will be able <strong>to question</strong> their proposals.</p><p><strong>Harry<br/></strong>He wants to question their proposals; it means to express doubts about their proposals and intentions. You know what, Neil? I'd rather have my passwords!</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, talking about passwords, let's go back to my quiz question. I asked you what the weakest passwords people use is, according to the 2014 report by the online security firm SplashData. The options were: abc123, the numbers 123456 and the words 'trustno' followed by the number 1.</p><p><strong>Harry<br/></strong>And I said the third one, 'trustno1'.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And you were… wrong I'm afraid Harry. The correct answer is B. The password '123456' has been named as the worst password of 2014. The other two were also in the list. Before we go, can you remind us of the words we heard today, Harry.</p><p><strong>Harry<br/></strong>The words were:</p><p>password</p><p>by heart</p><p>microchip</p><p>having teething problems</p><p>caution</p><p>to question</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Thank you.

I remember reading about this speech that Churchill gave in June 1940, when France was being invaded by the forces of Nazi Germany. </span></p><p class=""Default""><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, and this shows the spirit of this very famous leader still admired to this day. So much so that here in the UK we are marking the 50th anniversary of Winston Churchill's death.  </span></p><p class=""Default""><strong><span>Mike<br/></span></strong><span>He was a <strong>controversial</strong> figure wasn't he, Neil? Controversial – it means people have divided opinion about him. </span></p><p class=""Default""><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes he was quite a controversial figure. You'll learn more about him in this programme as well as some new words. But first, as ever, I'd like to ask you a quiz question, Mike.</span></p><p class=""Default""><span><strong>Mike<br/></strong>OK, I'm ready! </span></p><p class=""Default""><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Do you know a lot about Churchill?</span></p><p class=""Default""><span><strong>Mike<br/></strong></span><span>I think I do, yes. </span></p><p class=""Default""><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong></span><span>OK. We'll see about that. Which of these facts about Winston Churchill is false? Now, is it:</span></p><p class=""Default""><span>a)</span>    <span>He won the Nobel Peace Prize.</span></p><p class=""Default""><span>b)</span>    <span>He tried three times before passing exams to the Military Academy.</span></p><p class=""Default""><span>c)</span>    <span>He was a writer and a painter.</span></p><p class=""Default""><span><strong>Mike <br/></strong>I think it's (a). I think he won a Nobel Prize but I think it was Literature, not Peace.</span></p><p class=""Default""><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong></span><span>Well, we'll see at the end of the programme. Now, let's talk about Churchill. </span></p><p class=""Default""><span data-mce-mark=""1""><strong>Mike<br/></strong></span><span data-mce-mark=""1"">You know what, Neil, many people think Churchill has a lot to teach some of today's politicians. He was very <strong>determined</strong>, in other words, he was persistent. When Churchill believed in an idea, he didn't give up easily.   </span></p><p class=""Default""><span data-mce-mark=""1""><strong>Neil<br/></strong></span><span data-mce-mark=""1"">Yes. The Mayor of London Boris Johnson sees another good quality in Britain's wartime leader. He says there's one thing today's politicians do that Churchill didn't. What was it? How did he deal with issues? </span></p><p class=""Default""><span data-mce-mark=""1""><strong>Boris Johnson, Mayor of London<br/></strong></span><span data-mce-mark=""1"">It's an illusion to think that he was a guy who <strong>skated over</strong> the issues. He was deeply immersed in all the detail and all the technicality and that helped him to get the right answer. </span></p><p class=""Default""><span data-mce-mark=""1""><strong>Mike<br/></strong>Ah, Churchill didn't 'skate over' the issues. 'To skate over' means to avoid dealing with something. Churchill studied the issues in detail…</span></p><p class=""Default""><span data-mce-mark=""1""><strong>Neil<br/></strong>… and it helped him to get things right, according to Boris Johnson. One example is that Churchill actually went to Germany in the 1930s to assess the situation in the country first hand. </span></p><p class=""Default""><span><strong>Mike<br/></strong></span><span>Well, Nazi Germany was defeated and Churchill had a role in that. But there were other things he got wrong. He <strong>misjudged</strong> many situations. Misjudged, in other words, he formed a wrong opinion about them.</span></p><p class=""Default""><span data-mce-mark=""1""><strong>Neil<br/></strong>That's right! The historian Nigel Knight, a leading academic at Cambridge University, wrote a book about Churchill. He lists some of the mistakes made by the wartime leader throughout his political career. Now, let's listen. How does he describe Churchill's character? </span></p><p class=""Default""><span><strong>Dr Nigel Knight, author: ""Churchill: The Greatest Briton Unmasked""<br/></strong></span>Churchill was fundamentally <strong>flawed</strong>. So was his military<strong> strategy</strong>: Gallipoli in World War One, which was replicated in the Norwegian, North African and the soft underbelly of Europe campaigns during the World War Two. It was his economic strategy as chancellor in the 1920s, the return to the gold standards, his attitude towards India and the Indians, and indeed his post war 51-55 ministry, which was very <strong>lacklustre </strong>and very poor indeed.</p><p class=""Default""><span data-mce-mark=""1""><strong>Mike<br/></strong></span><span data-mce-mark=""1"">Nigel Knight calls Churchill 'flawed', it means he had a weakness in his character. And Churchill didn't get it right all the time. </span></p><p class=""Default""><span data-mce-mark=""1""><strong>Neil<br/></strong></span><span data-mce-mark=""1"">No. He occupied different posts in government and sometimes he didn't get his strategy, which means his plan of action, right. His strategy in some military campaigns ended up in disaster. </span></p><p class=""Default""><span><strong>Mike<br/></strong></span><span>And his strategy regarding the British economy may have actually contributed to a period of economic crisis known as the Great Depression. And when he became prime minister again, in the 50s, his government wasn't very good, was it Neil?</span></p><p class=""Default""><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong></span><span>No. Not according to the Cambridge academic Dr Nigel Knight. He called it 'lacklustre', which means dull, uninspiring. </span></p><p class=""Default""><span data-mce-mark=""1""><strong>Mike<br/></strong></span><span data-mce-mark=""1"">Well, we shall remember him mostly for his speeches in World War Two. </span></p><p class=""Default""><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, we're running out of time so I'll go back to our quiz question.</p><p class=""Default""><strong><span data-mce-mark=""1"">Mike<br/></span></strong><span data-mce-mark=""1"">You mentioned three facts about Winston Churchill and you said one of them was false, Neil. </span></p><p class=""Default""><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, and the options were: <br/></span><span><br/>a)</span>    <span>He won the Nobel Peace Prize.</span></p><p class=""Default""><span>b)</span>    <span>He tried three times before passing exams to the Military Academy.</span></p><p class=""Default""><span>c)</span>    <span>He was a writer and a painter.</span></p><p class=""Default""><span><strong>Mike<br/></strong></span><span>And I said I thought he won the Nobel Literature Prize, not the Peace Prize.</span></p><p class=""Default""><span data-mce-mark=""1""><strong>Neil<br/></strong></span><span data-mce-mark=""1"">And you were absolutely right! Churchill did win a Nobel Prize but it was for Literature because he wrote books about history. He was also a possible candidate for the 1945 Nobel Peace Prize but didn't win. Well, that's it for this programme but let's just remind ourselves of some of the words we've used today. </span></p><p class=""Default""><span data-mce-mark=""1""><strong>Mike <br/></strong></span><span data-mce-mark=""1"">They were:</span></p><p class=""Default""><span>surrender</span></p><p class=""Default""><span>controversial</span></p><p class=""Default""><span>determined</span></p><p class=""Default""><span>skate over</span></p><p class=""Default""><span>misjudged</span></p><p class=""Default""><span>flawed</span></p><p class=""Default""><span>strategy</span></p><p class=""Default""><span>lacklustre</span></p><p class=""Default""><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Thanks, Mike.

A recent report by Oxfam and Credit Suisse revealed how divided we all are when it comes to wealth. A lot of the wealth in the world is in the hands of very few people.

Surely they can't own more than that!</span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Well, we'll see if you got the right answer at the end of the programme. Now, let's talk about rich and poor. As we said, experts have concluded that more people are living better when you look at the world as a whole, but in individual countries you can find people with hardly anything to eat…</span></p><p><strong><span>Harry<br/></span></strong><span>…and others with lots of houses, cars, land and so on… So, Rob, how can this situation be reversed?</span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Well, David Bryer from Oxfam mentions a country which has achieved some success in trying to make the poor less poor. He is talking about Brazil. Listen to what Bryer says and tell me: what are the two words he uses meaning 'the least money people are paid for the work they do'?</span></p><p><strong>David Bryer from Oxfam<br/></strong>There are examples we can look to where countries are managing to reduce the gap between the super-rich and the rest. Brazil has historically very high levels of economic inequality. And they've been taking just some really sensible measures – measures around having more progressive <strong>tax</strong>, around investing in a higher <strong>minimum wage</strong>, investing in central public services, you know, these things that all governments can do that start to reverse this tide.</p><p><strong><span data-mce-mark=""1"">Harry<br/></span></strong><span data-mce-mark=""1"">So David Bryer talks about a 'minimum wage'. That's the least a worker receives in payment for work they've done. He meant that if people are paid a higher minimum wage, they can eat better, seek a better education, and their children can have a better job in the future. They can be lifted out of poverty.</span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>And the economy can grow. More people with more money buy more things and factories produce more. A factory which produces more will need more workers. So, more jobs for all. </span></p><p><strong><span>Harry<br/></span></strong><span>Right. Another measure by the Brazilian government which is mentioned by the representative from Oxfam has to do with tax. Tax is the amount of money you pay to the government depending on your salary and the cost of things you buy… But we have to admit this, Rob: taxes are not popular.</span></p><p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>That's true. Many people don't like paying tax because they don't receive an immediate benefit from it. Some very rich people try to pay as little as possible. But one billionaire who thinks it's important to pay and create conditions for governments to fight poverty is Bill Gates. The founder of Microsoft earned a lot of money, retired and, with his wife Melinda, created a foundation to help the poor. The BBC asked him what the very rich have to do to help reduce poverty. Let's listen to his answer. What does he say rich people have to be? The word is an adjective.</span></p><p><strong><span>Bill Gates, philanthropist<br/></span></strong>Well, their obligation of course is to pay their taxes, but our advice to them is that they all look at taking their wealth and being <strong>philanthropic</strong> - both in their own country and to help the global poorest. That's a full-time work Melinda and I do, we find it very <strong>fulfilling</strong>, we love seeing the progress.</p><p><span><strong>Harry<br/></strong>So rich people have to be 'philanthropic'! It means they have to help poor people by giving their money. </span></p><p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong></span><span>And he says he and his wife find this giving to the poor 'fulfilling', in other words, it makes them happy and satisfied. </span></p><p><strong><span>Harry<br/></span></strong><span>Well, that's his message to the very, very, very, very rich in the world! To the… 1%!</span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>The 1%...Well, you want the answer to my quiz question now, don't you?</span></p><p><strong><span>Harry<br/></span></strong><span>Yes. You asked me how much of the global wealth is owned by the richest 1% of the world's population. </span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>And the options I gave you were: 38%, 48% or 58%</span></p><p><strong><span>Harry<br/></span></strong><span>And I guessed 38% based on the fact that I couldn't imagine them earning more than that.</span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>I like your thinking, Harry, but I'm afraid the correct answer is actually (b) 48%. The wealthiest 1% will soon own more than the rest of the world's population – that's according to a study by anti-poverty charity Oxfam.</span> </p><p><strong><span>Harry<br/></span></strong><span>I think it's truly shocking that such a small number of people can own so much.</span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>You're right. It's an amazing statistic. OK, well, we're almost out of time but let's remind ourselves of some of the words that we've said today, Harry.</span></p><p><strong><span>Harry<br/></span></strong><span>standard of living</span></p><p><span>inequality</span></p><p><span>minimum wage</span></p><p><span>tax</span></p><p><span>philanthropic</span></p><p><span>fulfilling</span></p><p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well, that's it for today.

Rob and Neil talk about the price of vaccines. Listen to their conversation and learn some new vocabulary., 26 Feb 2015,,Transcript,"<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript</p><p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Hello, I'm Rob. Welcome to 6 Minute English. And with me in the studio today is Neil.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Hello, Rob.                                                                       </span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Today we’re going to talk about the cost of keeping people healthy. The price of life-saving vaccines has escalated – has gone up - and some of the world’s poorer countries are struggling <strong>to immunise</strong> children – to immunise, in other words, to prevent children from catching diseases.</span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, the organisation Medecins Sans Frontieres is criticising the pharmaceutical companies which produce the vaccines. Medecins Sans Frontieres is a well-known <strong>charity </strong>– a charity is an organisation set up to help and raise money for people in need. </span></p><p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>We’re going to talk about the cost of vaccines and you’ll learn some words you can use to discuss the topic yourself or to follow the news. But first, a question, Neil.</span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes?</span></p><p><strong><span>Rob</span></strong><span> <br/>The first laboratory-developed vaccine was produced in 1879. The vaccine was against an animal disease called chicken cholera. Who was the scientist behind it? Was it…</span></p><p><span>a) Alexander Fleming</span></p><p><span>b) Albert Sabin</span></p><p><span>c) Louis Pasteur</span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, I don’t know, but I’m going to guess. Probably not (a) because Fleming discovered penicillin. Probably not (c) because Pasteur did pasteurisation. I’m gonna go for (b).</span></p><p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>OK. It sounds like you know your vaccines. Well, we'll have the answer to that question at the end of the programme. Now, let’s talk about the controversy behind these life-saving vaccines. On one side we have a charity and on the other side, the drug companies.</span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Which vaccines are they talking about? </span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Well, they’re talking about vaccines which prevent diseases such as tuberculosis, measles, diphtheria and polio. According to Medecins Sans Frontieres, between 2001 and 2014 there was a 68-fold increase in vaccine prices. </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, that is a lot!</span></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>It certainly is. And the group says that there are particular cases in which rich western countries are actually getting vaccines at a cheaper rate than poorer countries. That’s what Medecins Sans Frontieres says, and they’re asking for more transparency around prices.</p><p><strong><span data-mce-mark=""1"">Neil<br/></span></strong><span data-mce-mark=""1""><strong>Transparency</strong> means clarity, something done in an open way, without secrets.</span></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes, they want to know the cost of the vaccines. Let’s hear what Rohit Malpani from Medecins Sans Frontieres has to say. See if you can spot the expression Malpani uses to describe how high the price of the vaccine is for some countries. </p><p><strong><span>Rohit Malpani, from Medecins Sans Frontieres<br/></span></strong><em><span>This is all a black box. It’s a black box in terms of the price they are charging to most countries around the world so they’re often charging prices that are wildly <strong>out of proportion</strong> with their ability to pay. You have Morocco and Tunisia that now are paying higher prices than France for the pneumococcal vaccine. We also simply do not know the cost of production and if GlaxoSmithKline says that it costs more than we are saying it does, then they should simply submit to some sort of audit to ensure that we can <strong>verify</strong> the cost of production. </span></em></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>The expression which describes the relationship between the price asked and the ability to pay is ‘out of proportion’. It means it’s unrealistic or exaggerated.</span></p><p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And Malpani from Medecins Sans Frontieres says that Morocco and Tunisia are paying more than France – a much richer country – for a particular vaccine. </span></p><p><span data-mce-mark=""1""><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And his organisation wants transparency. They want to be able <strong>to verify </strong>the cost of production. To verify means to confirm that something is really true and they want the drug company to confirm that the cost to produce the vaccines is really as high as they say it is.</span></p><p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong></span><span>Well, at this point, we have to hear what the companies say.</span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, because they argue that they already sell these vaccines at a <strong>discount</strong>, in other words, at a reduced price.</span></p><p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes, they do. GlaxoSmithKline says that around 80% of all their vaccines, including the one mentioned by Malpani, are provided to developing countries at a substantial discount. And the company adds that the pneumococcal vaccine is one of the most complex they’ve ever manufactured because it combines 10 vaccines in one. </span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes. On one hand, vaccines take many years of research and these companies want <strong>to make a profit</strong>, which means to sell the product for more than it costs to make it.</span></p><p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>But on the other hand, the lack of vaccines can kill people and it’s really very sad to see people dying of diseases which can be prevented. Some vaccines may be very affordable for a person in a rich country…</span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>… but they might cost a fortune to someone in a poor country.</span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>This is a very complex problem and I’m sure we will talk about this again in the future. But now, let’s go back to the quiz question, Neil.</span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>You asked about the first vaccine developed in a laboratory…</span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, I did. The first laboratory-developed vaccine was produced in 1879. It was a vaccine for the animal disease called chicken cholera. I wanted to know the name of the scientist who developed it. Was it Alexander Fleming, Albert Sabin or Louis Pasteur?</span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I said (b) Albert Sabin.</span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>And you were wrong! The correct answer is (C) Louis Pasteur, who was a French microbiologist. Now, Neil, the option you chose, the American scientist Albert Sabin, in fact developed an oral vaccine against polio in the 1950s – still very useful. And Alexander Fleming from Scotland did indeed discover penicillin, as you said.</p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, that is interesting and I’m a bit disappointed that I got it wrong actually.</span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Okay. Well, that’s it for this programme. Now let’s remember some of the words we used today, Neil. </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>to immunise</span></p><p><span>charity</span></p><p><span>transparency</span></p><p><span>out of proportion</span></p><p><span>to verify</span></p><p><span>discount</span></p><p><span>to make a profit</span></p><p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Thank you.

Welcome to 6 Minute English and with me in the studio is Neil.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Hello, Rob. </span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Hello. Feeling bright today, Neil?</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>I am feeling quite bright and clever, yes!</span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>That’s good to hear. Well, <strong>you’ll need all your wits about you</strong> – meaning you’ll need to think very quickly in this programme because we’re talking about intelligence, or to be more accurate, <strong>Artificial </strong>Intelligence. And we’ll learn some vocabulary related to the topic so that you can have your own discussion about it. Now, Neil, you know who Professor Stephen Hawking is, right?</span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, of course! Yes. Many people say that he’s a <strong>genius</strong> – in other words, he is very, very intelligent. Professor Hawking is one of the most famous scientists in the world and people remember him for his brilliance and also because he communicates using a <strong>synthetic</strong> voice generated by a computer – synthetic means it’s made from something non-natural. Artificial is similar in meaning – we use it when something is man-made to look or behave like something natural. </span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Well, Professor Hawking has said recently that efforts to create thinking machines are a threat to our existence. A <strong>threat</strong> means something which can put us in danger. Now, can you imagine that, Neil?!</span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, there’s no denying that good things can come from the creation of Artificial Intelligence. Computers which can think for themselves might be able to find solutions to problems we haven’t been able to solve. But technology is developing quickly and maybe we should consider the consequences. Some of these very clever robots are already surpassing us, Rob. <strong>To surpass</strong> means to have abilities superior to our own.</span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Yes. Maybe you can remember the headlines when a supercomputer defeated the World Chess Champion Gary Kasparov, to everybody’s astonishment. It was in 1997. What was the computer called, Neil? Was it:</span></p><p><span>a)</span>    <span>Red Menace</span></p><p><span>b)</span>    <span>Deep Blue</span></p><p><span>c)</span>    <span>Silver Surfer</span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I don’t know. I think (c) is probably not right. I think Deep Blue. That’s (b) Deep Blue.</span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Okay. You’ll know if you got it right at the end of the programme. Well, our theme is Artificial Intelligence and when we talk about this we have to mention the movies. </span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Many science fiction movies have explored the idea of bad computers who want to harm us. One example is 2001: A Space Odyssey. </span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, a good film. And another is The Terminator, a movie in which actor Arnold Schwarzenegger played an <strong>android</strong> from the future. An android is a robot that looks like a human. Have you watched that one, Neil?</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, I have. And the android is not very friendly. </span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>No, it’s not. In many movies and books about robots that think, the robots end up rebelling against their creators. But some experts say the risk posed by Artificial Intelligence is not that computers attack us because they hate us. Their problem is related to their efficiency. </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>What do you mean?</span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Well, let’s listen to what philosopher Nick Bostrom has to say. He is the founder of the Future of Humanity Institute at Oxford University. He uses three words when describing what’s inside the mind of a thinking computer. This phrase means ‘to meet their objectives’. What’s the phrase he uses?</span></p><p><strong><span>Nick Bostrom, philosopher, Future of Humanity Institute at Oxford University<br/></span></strong>The bulk of the risk is not in machines being evil or hating humans but rather that they are indifferent to humans and that in <strong>pursuit </strong>of <strong>their </strong>own <strong>goals</strong> we humans would suffer as a side effect. Suppose you had a super intelligent AI whose only goal was to make as many paperclips as possible. Human bodies consist of <strong>atoms </strong>and those atoms could be used to make a lot of really nice paperclips. If you want paperclips it turns out that in the pursuit of this you would have instrumental reasons to do things that would be horrible to humanity.</p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>A world in which humans become paperclips - wow, that’s scary! But the phrase which means ‘meet their objectives’ is to ‘pursue their goals’.</span></p><p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes, it is. So the academic explains that if you’re a computer responsible for producing paperclips, you will pursue your objective at any cost… </span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>… and even use atoms from human bodies to turn them into paperclips! Now that’s a horror story, Rob. If Stephen Hawking is worried, I think I might be too. How can we be sure that Artificial Intelligence – be it either a device or software – will have a <strong>moral compass</strong>? </span></p><p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Ah, a good expression - a moral compass - in other words, an understanding of what is right and what is wrong.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Artificial Intelligence is an interesting topic, Rob. I hope we can chat about it again in the future. But now I’m looking at the clock and we are running out of time, I’m afraid, and I’d like to know if I got the answer to the quiz question right?</span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Well, my question was about a supercomputer which defeated the World Chess Champion Gary Kasparov in 1997. What was the machine’s name? Was it: Red Menace, Deep Blue or Silver Surfer? </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And I think it’s Deep Blue.</span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Well, it sounds like you are more intelligent than a computer because you got the answer right. Yes, it was Deep Blue. The 1997 match was actually the second one between Kasparov and Deep Blue, a supercomputer designed by the company IBM and it was specialised in chess-playing. </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, I think I might challenge Deep Blue to a game obviously. I’m a bit of a genius myself.</span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Very good! Good to hear! Anyway, we’ve just got time to remember some of the words and expressions that we’ve used today, Neil.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>They were:</span></p><p><span>you’ll need your wits about you </span></p><p><span>artificial</span></p><p><span>genius</span></p><p><span>synthetic</span></p><p><span>threat </span></p><p><span>to surpass</span></p><p><span>to pursue their goals</span></p><p><span>moral compass</span></p><p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Thank you.

Listen to their conversation and learn some new vocabulary., 05 Feb 2015,,Transcript,"<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Hello, I'm Rob. Welcome to 6 Minute English. With me in the studio today is Neil. Hello, Neil!</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Hello there, Rob!</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Now I bet you have an impressive CV, Neil. <strong>CV</strong> is short for curriculum vitae - that's a Latin expression we use for the document in which people list their work history, education, interests and abilities. In other parts of the English-speaking world it's called a resume. Now, Neil, I know you are a very good teacher and producer, but does your CV actually shine?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>Well, I hope it's good enough to impress hiring managers. But it's a challenge to prove on a piece of paper or online document that you're really better than the other people who are competing for the same position.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/> </strong>Today we're talking about CVs and you'll learn some words related to this topic, which will especially interest <strong>jobseekers </strong>- that's what we call people looking for work.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, and jobseekers have to worry about having an impressive CV so they get that call for a job interview.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/> </strong>Yes, the CV is just the beginning. And, as you mentioned job interviews, I'll ask you a question all about this. According to a recent survey, managers decide quite quickly if they're going to really consider giving a candidate a job or not. So, when you go for a job interview how long do you have, on average, to make a good enough impression for an employer to hire you? Do you have...</p><p>a)     Less than 3 minutes</p><p>b)     Less than 5 minutes </p><p>c)     Less than 10 minutes</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, I think it's probably quite short so I'm going to go for: (b) 5 minutes.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well, you'll have the correct answer - the result of this survey - at the end of the programme. But people have done all sorts of unusual things to reach the interview level. One of them is Briton Daniel Conway, who went from posing shirtless in the street with the phrase ""employ me"" written on his chest to uploading a video on social media asking to be hired.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Ah, this video went <strong>viral </strong>- it means became popular very quickly. In it his daughter appears next to the phrase ""give my dad a job"".</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes. Daniel Conway tells us about his experience looking for work. Which word does he use when he says he wanted to be noticed?</p><p><strong>Daniel Conway, former jobseeker<br/> </strong><em>I just thought as a young naive kid that I would kind of walk into a job, but the truth is, you know, there are a lot of good people out there who got just as great skills and I realised at that point that you've got <strong>to stand out</strong> and <strong>get your strengths across</strong>.</em></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>He uses the phrasal verb to stand out - it means to be more visible than others in a group so that he can be noticed.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Dan Conway uses another phrasal verb: <strong>get your strengths across</strong> - to get something across means to make something clear. In this case he wants the employer to understand how good he is as a potential employee, his strengths and his good qualities.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And did he get a job?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well, yes, he did. And I'm glad to say that after four years this 29-year-old man got a job marketing vitamins!</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, we can say that he was good at marketing himself.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/> </strong>Yes, we can. Well, he was bold and courageous in his attempts to catch potential employers' attention. He showed a quality described by career coach Corinne Mills. Listen to what she says and tell me: what is the quality jobseekers have to show for sure. </p><p><strong>Corinne Mills, MD - Personal Career Management<br/></strong><em>You've got to be <strong>confident</strong>! I mean, if you are not confident about your skills and abilities, then why should an employer have faith in you? So, don't be <strong>modest</strong>. This is your opportunity to really show your skills and experience and what a great performer you're gonna be in the job.</em></p><p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>The career coach says you've got to be confident! It means self-assured, believe in your capacity to do things. And sometimes we feel that it isn't nice to say ""I'm very good at this"" or ""I'm wonderful at that"" but she advises you not to be modest.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Exactly. Modest means humble, moderate when talking about your abilities.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>You know, Rob, I've got some top tips for people writing their CV.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>OK, well, let's have them.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>Yes. Here is the first one: you have to be <strong>concise </strong>- it means brief, give the information in a few words. Maybe you could write a brief profile at the top and keep the CV to just two pages.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Thank you. That's a good bit of advice. And I think you should give evidence of success in previous jobs. If a presentation you did helped you to get a client you should include it there. And be <strong>accurate</strong>, in other words, be precise and tell the truth. Don't invent things.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And you should also remember to check your spelling and grammar!</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes, that's very important! Well, we wish everybody success when writing and sending out their CV, and we hope they are called for a job interview, in which they have a very short period of time to leave a good impression...</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Indeed! So how long after all is this period of time, according to your survey? Did I get the answer to the question you asked at the beginning of the programme right? </p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well, I asked you: how long do you have on average to make a good enough impression for an employer to hire you? Do you have less than 3 minutes, less than 5 minutes or less than 10 minutes?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I said less than 5 minutes.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And you're wrong. The correct answer is actually less than 10 minutes, so you'd have a little bit longer. Jobseekers have on average just six minutes and 25 seconds during the first meeting to impress potential employers. That's according to a new study from the website monster.co.uk. And we're almost out of time. So let's remember some of the words we said today, Neil.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>CV (curriculum vitae) </p><p>viral </p><p>to stand out </p><p>get your strengths across </p><p>confident </p><p>modest </p><p>concise </p><p>accurate </p><p><strong>Rob<br/> </strong>Thank you.

Welcome to 6 Minute English and with me in the studio is Rob. </p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Hello, Neil. </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>How are you today?<strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Rob<br/> </strong>I'm fine, thanks. How are you?<strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>I'm very well, actually. The weather has been nice lately, hasn't it?<strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Rob<br/> </strong>Yes, it has. The winter has been mild this year but... according to the forecast there might be some snow in parts of the country next week... And, you know, that's good because I love snow and we haven't seen much of it for quite a while. It's only rain, isn't it I...<strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>OK! OK! Enough! Enough now or they're going to think it's true that British people only talk about the weather!</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Right. </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>In this programme we're talking about conversation and how to start talking with people you don't know. In short: how to make <strong>small talk</strong>.<strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Rob<br/> </strong>Right. Well, small talk is what we call a polite and informal conversation about things which aren't really important or meaningful when meeting people socially - like at a party, for example. </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And in this programme you'll learn some vocabulary about communication. But first, a question: Rob, when do babies usually start talking? Is it when they are...</p><p>a) 9 months</p><p>b) 16 months or</p><p>c) 18 months </p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well, I know they start making noises at quite an early age. And I guess if that's talking, let me say (a) 9 months. </p><p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>OK. Well, we'll have the answer to that question at the end of the programme. Small talk is a social skill. Some people feel <strong>awkward</strong> - it means they feel uncomfortable, embarrassed - when they go to a party and don't know many people there. </p><p><strong>Rob<br/> </strong>Liz Brewer, the author of 'The Ultimate Guide to Party Planning and <strong>Etiquette</strong>', knows a lot about what to do on these occasions. Etiquette is the set of rules which indicate what behaviour in a society is acceptable and what is not.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, the author knows a lot about etiquette. Let's listen to her advice. What expression does she use to describe the act of attempting to start a conversation with someone?<strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Liz Brewer, author of 'The Ultimate Guide to Party Planning and Etiquette'<br/></strong><em>You walk into a room, there's a sea of faces, well... (the) first thing we do is... it's the weather. We do it because we are in fact <strong>breaking the ice</strong>. That is a code. That means 'I want to talk to you'. It's an easy subject, it's not too penetrating. We're very <strong>private </strong>people, we don't like to give too much information. So we are on safe ground. We start off with the weather. If that goes well, we then take it one step further.</em></p><p><strong>Rob<br/> </strong>Liz Brewer talks about breaking the ice. It means approaching someone you don't know and starting a friendly conversation with them.<strong><br/></strong></p><p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>And when you break the ice, talking about things which are not specific is the best way. You don't start a chat asking straight away where people live or what they do for a living.<strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Rob<br/> </strong>And, as the author said, we are very private people. Private describes someone who doesn't like to give away their personal information, opinions or share their feelings. So we need more time to open up to people we've just met.<strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>Good. So now you know what to do at a party when you don't know the other guests.<strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Rob<br/> </strong>But, Neil. There is one particular situation I'm not sure how to deal with. This is when I forget the name of the person I've been making small talk with.<strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>Yes, I know what that's like. You might not feel comfortable about allowing the person to realise you didn't really catch their name. It might sound <strong>rude</strong>.<strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Rob<br/> </strong>Yes, that's right. I don't want to sound rude - which means ill-mannered or unpleasant. The person I've just managed to approach might think I don't care. </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Let's see what tip author on etiquette Liz Brewer has for us. Which words does she use instead of ""I have forgotten""? </p><p><strong>Liz Brewer, author of ""The Ultimate Guide to Party Planning &amp; Etiquette""<br/></strong><em>You can say ""Oh, just your name... it has just <strong>slipped my mind</strong> for the moment"". And they say ""Paul"", (you say) ""Oh no, no, no, I know you are Paul, it was the surname"". Or they give you the surname and then you add the other. As I say, small talk is a code towards getting information and going further. Once you feel comfortable, then you can have these wonderful in-depth conversations. Those are the kinds of things you want to probably do later.</em><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Rob<br/> </strong>Liz Brewer says ""your name has just slipped my mind"", it's a gentler way of saying that they've just forgotten the person's name. And pretending that you knew the person's name but you want the other name is a clever trick. </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, it might sound like you forgot the name, but not completely. And this author shows that you have to interact with people in a charming way. </p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes... well, my co-presenter... your name has just slipped my mind for the moment...</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Come on, Rob. You know! You know it's Neil. </p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes, it is Neil. I'm just practising my social skills there. </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, I'm afraid you have to practise some other time because... well, I don't want to sound rude but we are running out of time. Let me give you the correct answer to the quiz question now. </p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes. You asked me ""When do babies usually start talking?"" and you gave me three options. </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, and the options were 9 months, 16 months or 18 months. </p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And I went for the first one, 9 months. Was I right? </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>You were wrong. The correct answer was (c) 18 months. Now, according to the website webmd.com, there are some milestones in speech development. At 6 months, your baby begins babbling with different sounds. For example, your baby may say ""ba-ba"" or ""da-da"". And then, after that, at 9 months, babies can understand a few basic words. At the age of 18 months babies say up to 10 simple words. </p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Ah, interesting stuff. And we are still learning words now, aren't we?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>We are. Well, enough of this small talk. Let's remember some of the words we used today, Rob.<strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>They were:</p><p>small talk</p><p>awkward</p><p>etiquette</p><p>breaking the ice</p><p>private</p><p>rude</p><p>slipped my mind </p><p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>That's it for this programme.

Listen to their conversation and learn some new vocabulary., 22 Jan 2015,,Transcript,"<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Hello, I'm Rob. Welcome to 6 Minute English. With me in the studio today is Neil. Hello, Neil. </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Hi. Hi Rob!</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Are you alright, Neil? Are you playing on your <strong>smartphone</strong> again, are you?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Err... what was that? Yeah, sorry, Rob... just doing something on my smartphone, you know, the kind of phone which allows you to go online.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Oh I can see that. But are you waiting for a call?<strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>No. No, I just carry it with me at all times. Where I go, the phone goes. No phone, no Neil!</p><p><strong>Rob<br/> </strong>OK, but why do you need your phone so much? </p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Why?! What if I need to need to go somewhere? How will I find my way? What about the weather? Will it rain today? I need to know these things.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Why don't you just look up in the sky and see if it is cloudy?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Look up to see if it is going to rain?! I have an <strong>app</strong> - which is short for an application, which is a computer programme for a specific purpose. My app tells me the weather... and this one does all the maths I need... and here's one for translations, and this one here... can tell me what I'm going to...</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>OK, OK, OK, I get the point. Today we're talking about computers - and we'll bring you some words <strong>connected</strong> with the digital age.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Connected - <strong>to connect</strong> - we use this verb a lot. It means 'to link, or join, one thing to another thing. In this case, connected means 'linked to the internet'.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>OK, I can see you are very excited about computers. So that's what my question is all about. The first commercially produced ""desktop computer"" was designed and produced by the Italian company Olivetti and presented at an event in New York. When did it happen? Was it in:</p><p> </p><p>a)     1955</p><p> </p><p>b)     1965 or</p><p> </p><p>c)     1975<strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, I think it's (a) 1955.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Very interesting. You'll get the right answer at the end of the programme. Now, let's talk about computers. You can't live without them but American technology writer Nicholas Carr, the author of a book called 'The Glass Cage - where automation is taking us', thinks they might cause problems.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Problems?! They cause us problems when they <strong>crash</strong> - that's what we say when our computer suddenly stops working.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well, not just that. Let's listen to Nicholas Carr. He says if we rely too much on computers we lose something. But what is it?</p><p><strong>American technology writer Nicholas Carr<br/></strong><em>The ability of computers to do things we used to do is growing astronomically and we're rushing to hand over to computers tasks, activities - both in our work lives and in our personal lives - and what you begin to see is what is often called a <strong>de-skilling</strong> effect. The person becoming reliant on computers; because they are not exercising their own <strong>talents</strong>, those talents begin to fade. And we begin to lose, as a result, the unique things that human beings can do that computers can't: feel <strong>empathy</strong>, take a broad perspective, interpret all the stuff that can't be turned into data.</em></p><p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>According to Nicholas Carr, using computers means that we are losing skills - he talks about 'de-skilling'. A skill is the ability to do something well because we've practised it.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/> </strong>And he also talks about the loss of talent - talent is a natural ability to do something - you didn't have to learn it, you're just naturally good at it. It's something we're all born with. Carr says that relying on computers means our talent is fading because we don't use it any more.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And he goes even further and says we're losing some of the things that make us human, like empathy, the ability to imagine and understand what other people might be feeling.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/> </strong>So, do you agree with this writer, Neil? </p><p><strong>Neil<br/> </strong>I think he's got a point actually.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/> </strong>It's like the friendships we make on social media. It is nice to get to know new people in different countries, but we have to remember that it's important to talk to people face-to-face too.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So... maybe we shouldn't use <strong>GPS</strong> to find our way around all the time. GPS, the global positioning system which gives us directions with the help of satellites orbiting the Earth... instead, have a conversation with someone - ask for directions.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes, and perhaps we can give the <strong>spellchecker</strong> a miss occasionally. A spellchecker is a very useful piece of software which helps us avoid making spelling mistakes when we're typing on a computer but... it is good to actually learn how to spell the words properly and not leave everything to the machine.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Good idea, Rob. I'll try not to rely so much on digital technology. Computers are here to stay and they'll become more and more sophisticated, but we have to remember they are just tools.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes, computers are here to stay. And by the way, when was the first commercially produced ""desktop computer"" launched? As I told you, it was designed and created by Olivetti and launched in New York. But when was it launched? Was it: 1955, 1965 or 1975?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I said 1955.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Perhaps you should ask your smartphone because the correct answer is actually (b) 1965.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I don't believe it!</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>The computer was called Programma 101 and it was presented at the New York World's Fair. They sold 44,000 units all over the world. The initial price in the US was US$ 3,200. Well, we are almost out of time so let's remind ourselves of some of the words we said today, Neil.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>smartphone</p><p> </p><p>app (application)</p><p> </p><p>to connect</p><p> </p><p>crash</p><p> </p><p>skill</p><p> </p><p>talent</p><p> </p><p>empathy</p><p> </p><p>GPS (Global Positioning System)</p><p> </p><p>spellchecker </p><p><strong>Rob<br/> </strong>Thank you.

Rob and Neil talk about the move and consider the reaction among smokers.", 15 Jan 2015,,Transcript,"<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript</p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Hello, I'm Neil. Welcome to 6 Minute English. With me in the studio today is Rob.</span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Hello, Neil.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Traditionally, January is the month in which people try to make their New Year's resolutions work. Some want to get fit, others swear they will drink less alcohol and there are those who want to stop smoking.</span></p><p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Many people might wish to stop smoking here in England because, according to a plan, smoking in cars with children will be banned under new laws put forward by the government.</span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And a similar move is being discussed in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Today we're talking about this new proposal restricting where people are allowed to smoke. And you'll learn some related vocabulary so you can have your own discussion on the subject.</span></p><p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>We usually talk about smoking as a<strong> habit</strong> – that's what we do every day without even thinking and it's difficult to give up. Well, this ban is going to cause <strong>controversy</strong>, in other words, disagreement expressed in an angry, public way. </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil</span></strong><span> <br/>Yes, smokers are trying hard to carry on enjoying their cigarettes. But there are a couple of places where they've already lost the battle, Rob.</span></p><p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And where's that?</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>I'm giving you a chance to tell me. Bans on smoking in cars where children are present already exist in some regions of particular countries. Is it:</span></p><p><span>a)</span>    <span>in the French capital, Paris</span></p><p><span>b)</span>    <span>in some US states</span></p><p><span>c)</span>    <span>in Greece</span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>I don't know but I'm gonna go for b) in some US states.</span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>OK. Well, we'll have the answer to that question at the end of the programme. </span><span>Now let's hear the argument in favour of a ban. Here's Dr Hilary Wareing. She is the director of the Tobacco Control Collaborating Centre, which works with the World Health Organisation.</span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>The World Health Organisation is <strong>campaigning </strong>to discourage people from smoking. Campaigning means working in an organised and active way to achieve an objective.</span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Listen out for what Dr Wareing calls the smoke from other people's cigarettes.  </span></p><p><strong><span>Dr Hilary Wareing, Tobacco Control Collaborating Centre in Britain<br/></span></strong><em><span>Those children who are exposed to <strong>second-hand smoke</strong> in cars are more likely to end up going to their doctors with respiratory infections, more likely to end up going to hospital with a respiratory infection and much more likely to get a wheeze or actually have <strong>asthma</strong> through their childhood. </span></em></p><p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>So Dr Wareing calls smoke from other people's cigarette <strong>second-hand smoke</strong>. Second-hand is something which has had a previous owner.  </span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And she also mentions <strong>asthma</strong>. This is an illness you hear a lot about when people discuss the effects of tobacco smoke and pollution on people's lungs. People with asthma sometimes find it difficult to breathe. You faced this problem as a child, didn't you, Rob?</span></p><p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Asthma? No, but when I was a kid my brother, who was much older than me, used to smoke in the car. Now, the smell was terrible, the smoke bothered me a lot and even if I don't have asthma now, I just don't like breathing in smoke. If people want to smoke, it's their personal choice, but not near me.</span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>The proposal under discussion here in England includes a <strong>fine</strong> of up to £50 – that's about $80 – imposed on the driver of the car if there's somebody smoking when there's a child passenger.</span></p><p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>A fine is the money you pay as a punishment for having broken the law. And the driver is responsible, even if he is not the person smoking in the car. This will really cause some conflict.</span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>It probably will. But it's difficult to find anyone who doesn't defend a child's right to be healthy. Children are <strong>vulnerable</strong> – vulnerable means they are exposed to harm and can't defend themselves. We have to protect them. But many smokers see this proposal with suspicion.</span></p><p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes, in the last few years, smokers have seen restrictions in their ability to smoke. In many countries they aren't allowed to smoke in closed public places like bars anymore. And cigarette packages show disturbing pictures of diseased lungs.</span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Smoking doesn't look so cool anymore. One of the smokers suspicious of the new ban is Hayley. This British driver said she doesn't smoke when her children are on board. But that's as far as she goes in agreeing with the ban.</span></p><p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>What objection – I mean what reason for disagreeing – is she raising?</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Listen out for the two words Hayley uses when talking about the physical area surrounding her which she feels is very personal.</span></p><p><strong><span>Hayley, a smoker<br/></span></strong><em><span>If they are going to stop it with people in the cars with their children I completely agree with that. I completely understand where they are coming from, but to take it to the next level of stopping it even if you haven't got children in the car then I think that's a little bit beyond people's <strong>personal space</strong>, really.</span></em></p><p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Hayley talks about her personal space – it means the area around her body which she feels is hers and if invaded makes her feel uncomfortable. In this case, Hayley feels that her car is her personal space and she should be able to choose if she wants to smoke in it.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, it seems that enforcing this ban will be a bit of a challenge for the authorities. There's a ban on smoking inside buses but I tell you, sometimes I can smell smoke from somewhere.</span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>They breach the law at their own peril. But other places have managed to implement the ban on smoking in cars with child passengers. So what's the answer to the question you put earlier in the programme, Neil?</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Where are people not allowed by law to smoke in private cars with children on board: is it Paris, some US states or Greece?</span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Well, I said some US states.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And you were correct!</span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Oh good.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, the proposal here in England has yet to be voted for in Parliament and it might be implemented only by October. </span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>So plenty of time there for a good debate. </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yes but two people who can't continue the discussion, at least for the moment, are both of us. That's because we've run out of time, Rob. Let's just remember some of the words used today.</span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>habit</span></p><p><span>controversy</span></p><p><span>campaigning</span></p><p><span>second-hand smoke</span></p><p><span>asthma</span></p><p><span>fine</span></p><p><span>vulnerable</span></p><p><span>personal space</span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>That's it for today.

Labour laws and company policies have been used to curtail it. But is bullying just an attempt to give a bad name to what is actually part of human nature?, 08 Jan 2015,,Transcript,"<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript</p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Hello, I'm Rob. Welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm joined today by Neil. Hello, Neil!</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Hi there, Rob! </span></p><p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Today we are talking about a very serious topic: bullying. And you're going to learn some vocabulary related to this topic.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>It's a serious matter because it can leave people traumatised. </span></p><p><span><strong>Rob<br/>Traumatised</strong>, it means, they end up with emotional wounds which affect them psychologically. Bullies want to intimidate people.</span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/>To intimidate</strong>, in other words, to make people fear them. Yes, it does make people feel they can't help themselves - they're powerless. They feel <strong>helpless</strong>.  </span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Unfortunately, bullying has been increasing in the workplace in spite of laws against it. Let's go for some figures. Are you ready for a question, Neil? </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, I am.</span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>The Workplace Bullying Institute based in the US conducted a survey last year. How much of the American workforce has experienced bullying at work? Was it: </span></p><p><span>a) 7%</span></p><p><span>b) 27%</span></p><p><span>c) 47%</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, I don't know but I’m going to go for 27%.</span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>OK. I'll give you the answer by the end of the programme.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>I'm very keen to know, Rob. Intimidating people is a bad thing but some might say that, well, aggression is part of human nature.</span></p><p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes, that's an interesting point, Neil. I can imagine big strong men imposing their will by force in the Stone Age, but behaving this way now probably isn't a good idea. The California-based anthropologist Christopher Boehm explains. Listen and then tell me: what made bullying go out of fashion?</span></p><p><strong><span>Christopher Boehm, Anthropologist at the University of California, US<br/></span></strong><em><span>About a quarter of a million years ago, humans began to hunt zebras and antelope. And they had <strong>to cooperate</strong> to do so because their weapons were rather primitive and they did not want <strong>alpha males</strong> to be dominating the carcass after it was killed. So the thing that everyone else did was to start killing alpha males. Bullies simply were not tolerated.   </span></em></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Ah, people had <strong>to cooperate</strong> with each other - in other words, to work together for their mutual benefit. They were hunting animals for food.  </span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, and nobody wanted the <strong>alpha male</strong> - the strong man in the group who wanted to dominate everybody else - to take all the meat for himself.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>So about 250,000 years ago, when human society was evolving, people realised it wasn't good for the community to have a bully around. </span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong>No. So if we make a big jump in history and back to the 21st century, well, modern companies value cooperation. People's wellbeing matters too.</p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>That's right. Many countries have laws against bullying which is part of the companies' human resources policy. </span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span><strong>Human Resources</strong> - also known by the initials HR - is the department which hires new employees and stores information about their career at the company. </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And what sort of behaviour is considered bullying in the civilised world?</span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>That's what Helene Guldberg is about to explain to us. She's a specialist in developmental psychology. What's the main thing that defines bullying?<br/><br/></span><strong><span>Helene Guldberg, developmental psychologist<br/></span></strong><em><span>Something that is <strong>intentional</strong> on the part of the perpetrator; it has to involve some kind of power imbalance, so it's not an argument between equals, and it's something that is repetitive. So it's not a one off rage by one person against another. The intent is to cause harm, which can be psychological or physical. </span></em></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>To be considered bullying, the behaviour has to be <strong>intentional</strong>, which means it has to be planned or deliberate. </span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And also has to happen many times and involve power. </span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, indeed. One person has to have more power than the other.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>You know, Rob, this idea of intention is very important, because some people are just more confident and demanding then others. They might say that they didn't mean to cause any harm. They don't mean to bully anyone.</span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Yes. But it can be interpreted differently. Darren Treadway, at the State University of New York, studied bullying in the workplace. He uses a word which means the way someone interprets something they see or hear. Which word is it?<br/><br/></span><strong><span>Darren Treadway, at the State University of New York, US<br/></span></strong><em><span>At the end of the day, if the target feels as if they're being bullied, the corporation needs to make sure they're addressing that feeling. If you're the supervisor who's... your subordinate says that they're being bullied by you or abused by you, while you may not feel you're doing that, it's your responsibility as a communicator to make sure that they are getting the accurate <strong>perception</strong> of your behaviour. Being known as a bully is a stigma that nobody in a corporation wants.</span></em></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>It's <strong>perception</strong>. According to Darren Treadway, bullying is a matter of perception - the way some action is interpreted by a person, in this case, a subordinate. </span></p><p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And supervisors have to be aware of how their subordinates see their behaviour. </span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>It's all a matter of communication. </span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, indeed. But we are running out of time, I'm afraid. Let's go back to the question I put to you earlier in the programme. It's about a survey by the Workplace Bullying Institute. I asked how much of the American workforce has experienced bullying in the workplace. The options were 7%, 27% and 47%.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>And I guessed 27%.</span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>And you guessed very well. The answer is indeed 27%. What do you think about that?</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, it's depressingly high, isn't it?</span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, it is. OK. Well, before we go, could you remind us of some of the words that we've heard today, Neil?</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yes. We've heard: </span></p><p><span>traumatised</span></p><p><span>to intimidate</span></p><p><span>helpless</span></p><p><span>to cooperate</span></p><p><span>alpha male</span></p><p><span>human resources</span></p><p><span>intentional</span></p><p><span>perception</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Right.

Rob and Neil talk about what to include in a time capsule - a device used to keep the memory of a place in time alive.", 01 Jan 2015,,Transcript,"<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript</p><p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Hello, I'm Rob. Welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm joined today, at the start of a brand new year, by Neil.</span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Hello, Rob! I'm really looking forward to 2015, but I have to say that last year was great. So great I'm thinking about creating my own time capsule.</span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Really? A <strong>time capsule</strong>? You mean a kind of box or container where you can store objects and information so that people in the future - yourself included - will know how we lived at this particular time?</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>That's it! And I'm already collecting items. My old mobile phone which I don't use anymore. And a woolly jumper with a snowman on it my granny gave me that I never wear...</span></p><p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>You never wear? </span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>It's a pretty silly jumper, Rob. She said it's to <strong>remind</strong> <strong>me</strong> of how much she loves me. Remind, which means, makes me remember - but all it makes me think of is that she still treats me like a child! I'll include the Christmas card which came with it! </span></p><p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well, you've got to choose the items you wish to keep as a memory of our time very carefully. It's a <strong>historical record</strong> - that usually means a piece of writing or a narrative of events at a particular time. Well, let's discuss time capsules and vocabulary related to memory. But first, a question to test your knowledge of time capsules. The International Time Capsule Society is based at Oglethorpe University in Atlanta, in the US, and it studies these artefacts. According to this organisation, how many time capsules are estimated to exist in the world today? Is it: </span></p><p><span>a)         up to 15,000</span></p><p><span>b)         up to 150,000 or</span></p><p><span>c)         up to 1,500,000</span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>I'm gonna go for (a) 15,000.</span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>OK, up to 15,000.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>That's the one.</span></p><p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>OK. Well, as usual, you'll have the answer to that question at the end of the programme. Right, now, let's talk more about time capsules. One of them was in the news in the last couple of weeks. A capsule was found in a public building in Boston. </span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Ah, I've heard about this. Historians believe it was put there by Samuel Adams and Paul Revere, and other American revolutionaries in the 18th century! </span></p><p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>OK. Let's listen to BBC reporter Rajini Vaidyanathan. Can you tell me exactly where this time capsule was hidden?</span></p><p><strong><span>Rajini Vaidyanathan, BBC reporter in Washington<br/></span></strong><span><em>It was during repair work at the Massachusetts State House in Boston that the time capsule was discovered hidden in the <strong>cornerstone</strong>. It’s thought the time capsule was first placed there in the 1795, when the building was constructed. Officials believe it contains old coins and newspapers which could have <strong>deteriorated</strong> over time.</em> </span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Ah, the time capsule was hidden in the cornerstone, which is a stone representing the starting place in the construction of a monumental building. Usually it has the date carved on it.</span></p><p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes the time capsule's items date from over 200 years ago, so the historians are concerned about opening it. The newspapers particularly might have <strong>deteriorated</strong>, decayed or decomposed over time.  </span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Paper doesn't last long. But my old mobile phone - the one I'm going to put in my own time capsule - will be <strong>eternal</strong>, it means it will exist forever! And the historians of the future will be grateful! </span></p><p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well, if you want to make the historians happy, put things which are current in your life and things you actually use in your time capsule. There are famous capsules to be opened: the American company Westinghouse created two of them. One for the 1939 New York World's Fair and the other for the same event in 1964.</span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And when are they going to open it? </span></p><p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>In the 25th century! <strong> </strong></span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Wow! Well, that's it, Rob. I'm going home and I'm going to start working on my own time capsule!</span></p><p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Good. I'm glad to see you're so enthusiastic, Neil. But be careful not to make the mistake these guys in the Writtle Junior School here in England made. They put their items in a box 25 years ago and they buried the capsule in the garden.</span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And what happened to it? It isn't centuries later but it must be interesting for these people who are now adults to see what's inside. </span></p><p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well, it would have been interesting. But it didn't happen. Listen to Headteacher Nick Taylor and tell me why they didn't open their time capsule.</span></p><p><strong><span>Nick Taylor, Writtle School Headteacher<br/></span></strong><em>There were letters in it, coins, various things so we called in Writtle Heritage and they had a good explore around the garden with their <strong>metal detectors</strong>, and they couldn't find any evidence of it. I think we’ve dug about three holes around our school garden but we had to stop because we were slowly destroying it.</em></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>They forgot where they buried it!</span></p><p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes. And they used <strong>metal detectors</strong> - electronic devices which can find metallic objects underground - and even so they couldn't find their time capsule! And before I forget, let's go back to the question I asked at the beginning of the programme.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>You asked how many time capsules are estimated to exist in the world today. </span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, and the options were up to 15,000, up to 150,000 or up to 1,500,000. And you said...</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Yes, I said up to 15,000.</span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>And this is the right answer!</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Hurrah!</span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Well done! Yes, the International Time Capsule Society has set up a registry of time capsules, and it estimates there are 10,000 to 15,000 time capsules worldwide. And the organisation believes that more than 80% of all time capsules are lost and will not be opened on their intended date.</span></p><p><strong><span>Neil<br/></span></strong><span>Well, I will remember where I kept mine. That's for sure.</span></p><p><strong><span>Rob<br/></span></strong><span>Good for you. Well, that's it from us for the moment. We've been talking about time and... we've run out of it. But let's just remember some of the words used today. Neil...</span></p><p><span><strong>Neil<br/></strong>time capsule</span></p><p><span>remind</span></p><p><span>historical record</span></p><p><span>cornerstone</span></p><p><span>deteriorated</span></p><p><span>eternal</span></p><p><span>metal detectors</span></p><p><span><strong>Rob<br/></strong>That's it for today.

English and German soldiers fighting each other during World War One left their positions to sing together and play football.

I'm joined today by Finn.</p><p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Hi Rob! Merry Christmas everyone!</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes. Merry Christmas! Today we're talking about this celebration. It's a Christian festival but its message of peace among people is universal.</p><p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>It's a pity that today we are far from that - from a moment of absolute peace and <strong>goodwill</strong>. Now, goodwill means a cooperative attitude.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>But there was once a brief moment in history when the human spirit rose above wars.</p><p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Ah, you must be talking about the Christmas Truce which happened in World War One, in 1914!</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>It's the perfect occasion to talk about it, because this year marks the <strong>centenary</strong> - the 100 year anniversary - of the start of Britain's involvement in this European conflict. And we'll look at some related vocabulary during the programme. But, before we go into this extraordinary event, a question about the First World War, Finn.</p><p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>For me... well... I'm not an expert on the First World War so... we'll let's see how I do...</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>I'm sure you'll know the answer to this one. It's about letters. People didn't have email in the early 20th century so they wrote lots of letters. But do you know how many letters were delivered to the front - the place where the fighting happened - every week? Were there:</p><p>a)       one million</p><p>b)       five million or</p><p>c)       an incredible twelve million letters?</p><p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Right. Well, I know there were a lot of people at the front but I'm going to say a) one million.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>OK. Well, as usual, you'll have the answer to that question at the end of the programme. Right, now, let's talk about this <strong>unofficial truce</strong> which happened 100 years ago in the Western Front of the First World War.</p><p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Yes, so a truce is an agreement between people to stop fighting, with no winner or loser. Now, it's <strong>unofficial</strong> - which means it's not authorised by people in a position of authority, in this case, the governments involved in the war. So the soldiers just decided to simply stop fighting. How was this possible, Rob? How did this happen?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well, soldiers from both <strong>trenches</strong>, all of a sudden, started to <strong>fraternise</strong> - which means they began to meet each other socially.</p><p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And the trenches were big holes dug by soldiers from which they attacked the enemy. Living conditions were terrible in these holes.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>This truce might have had something to do with the bad conditions in these trenches. Let's hear what German historian Michael Jurgs has to say about the event. Which expression does he use to describe how the soldiers felt about the war?</p><p><strong>INSERT</strong></p><p><strong>Michael Jurgs, author of The Small Peace in the Great War<br/></strong>I think it happened because they were all <strong>fed up with</strong> the war. They were promised they would be at home again, Christmas 1914 and after five months of the World War One, there were already a million dead young people, eighteen, nineteen, twenty years old. And at Christmas night the muddy weather became frosty and cold and then from the German trenches, from the German trenches - that sounds unbelievable because always Germans started wars, or joined wars - began the song, 'Silent Night, Holy Night'. That was the beginning.</p><p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>The German historian said the soldiers were fed up with the war - which is an informal way of saying they were bored, or annoyed with it.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>The war was continuing and they wished they were home with their families. One night, it was cold and the German soldiers started to sing a song... a carol...</p><p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Yes. A carol is a happy song with a religious element - usually a Christmas song. And the carol they sang was (sings a bit of Silent Night).</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>(Joins in the singing) Yes. That's the carol 'Silent Night, Holy Night' and it <strong>broke the ice</strong> between the soldiers. That means it made these men, who didn't know each other personally, more relaxed.</p><p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And you know Rob? I really find it fascinating how spontaneous all of this was!</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>It was indeed.</p><p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>So how did the authorities respond to this?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>They didn't like it at all. They banned this sort of fraternising and it didn't happen again. But not before the soldiers from opposing armies played some football together.<strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Football?!</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes. They played a match in <strong>no-man's-land</strong>! That's a strip of land between enemy sides over which nobody has control. It was the area between the English trench and the German trench.</p><p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>You know, it's a really nice story, isn't it? It's quite a touching story, Rob.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes, and very inspiring. Well, our time is almost up so let's get the right answer to the quiz question. I asked you how many letters were delivered to the front every week. The options were: one million, five million or twelve million.</p><p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And I said one million, Rob.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And you were a long way off.</p><p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Oh, really?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes. The correct answer is (c) twelve million letters.</p><p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Twelve million a week?!</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes, a week. By the end of the war, two billion letters and 114 million parcels had been delivered to the front.  According to statistics, 65 million people around the world fought in this war, which ended in 1918.</p><p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>That's really quite incredible Rob!</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Some incredible figures there. OK. Let's remember some of the words we explained today.</p><p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>They were:</p><p>goodwill</p><p>centenary</p><p>truce</p><p>unofficial</p><p>trenches</p><p>fraternise</p><p>fed up with</p><p>carol</p><p>broke the ice</p><p>no-man's-land</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Thank you, Finn.

Where did you learn to speak Chinese?</p><p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>At university. Though I must say I'm a bit <strong>rusty </strong>now!</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Rusty? You look OK, but what you really mean is you're not as fluent as you were before!</p><p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>That's right.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Learning, and practising, a language requires effort. But the children of the school in London that we're going to be hearing about today had no choice. They're from different countries and no less than 42 languages are spoken in the <strong>playground</strong>.</p><p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>It's incredible! In the playground – that's the area in the schoolyard where children play during their break between lessons – they speak 42 languages?! Wow.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes. Of course they all have to learn English because they live here. But more on that in a moment. First, as the tradition goes, I'm going to challenge you with a question, Finn.</p><p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>OK. I'm ready or... 我准备好了!</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Huh?</p><p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>I'm ready!</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>OK. Which country has the most official languages? Is it:</p><p>a) India</p><p>b) Nigeria</p><p>c) South Africa</p><p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Good question. I would say India or Nigeria... Let's say Nigeria.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>OK. I will reveal the answer at the end of the programme! So let's talk about Byron Court, a school with 600 pupils in north-west London. The school gets high <strong>marks</strong> for <strong>integration</strong>.</p><p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Marks - so here you mean scores in tests or exams. They get high marks for integration - integration means bringing people together - as they have pupils from all over the world. </p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes, they come from places as far apart as Iraq, Somalia, India, Romania and Slovakia. Many are children of immigrants and refugees.</p><p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>So how difficult is it for these children to learn English?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well, let's listen to this pupil from Byron Court. Where did she learn her first words in English?</p><p><strong><strong>Pupil, Byron Court school, London<br/></strong></strong><em>When I was two years old I went to nursery and then I learnt a bit of English there. And when I came here I got to learn all my English.</em></p><p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>She says she began to learn English at nursery - that's a place where very young children are looked after while their parents are at work.<strong style=""font-size: 12px;""> </strong></p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Byron Court's <strong>head teacher</strong> - the person in charge of a school - believes children feel integrated because she tries to celebrate all the different cultures and avoids suggesting one culture is better than the other.</p><p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>It all sounds very nice, Rob, but I wonder what happens in the classroom. I mean, many pupils are learning basic words in English while, at the same time, studying things like science and maths also in English. So, quite a challenge?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>It is indeed a big problem.</p><p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>So does this lower <strong>educational standards</strong>? Those are the knowledge and skills students should have at a particular level.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes it does, but not for long, says Martyn Pendergast, educational officer at Brent Council, that's the area where the school is located. Listen out for the verb he uses which means testing children's performance.</p><p><strong>Martin Pendergast, educational officer at Brent Council<br/></strong><em>In Brent our children perform just below national averages when they are assessed at seven years old. But by the time they're 11 they've caught up with national standards, and at 16 they're flying.</em></p><p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>He says they are assessed - which means tested and given scores - when they are seven years old. At that time they have worse results than children in other British schools.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>But by the time they celebrate their 11th birthday, they've caught up - they've become equal with pupils of their age elsewhere in the country.</p><p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And by 16, he says, ""they are flying"", which is a nice way to describe these children's progress. It's good for them because they end up as <strong>bilingual</strong> adults - speaking two languages fluently.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>So their effort pays off. At Byron Court the concern is more about pupils who are native speakers of English.</p><p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Parents worry about their children not learning much.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Maybe the best thing is for everybody to try to learn a second language. Not a bad thing in today's small world.</p><p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Talking about learning languages, I want to know if I got the answer to your question right. The question was about the country with the most official languages.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And the options I put to you were India, Nigeria or South Africa.  </p><p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And I said Nigeria. But... maybe I think India now. Can I change my mind?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>You can if you want because you'd still be wrong.</p><p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Oh, no, really?</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>The country with most official languages is the Republic of South Africa with 11 languages. </p><p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Eleven!</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Interestingly India has 18 languages that are recognised by its constitution and can be considered as official, however, the difference is that each language is recognised as the official language of a certain area such as Kashmir, for example. </p><p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>OK. Right. So I was kind of right in a different way.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>The overall official language is Hindi.</p><p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Fascinating! Well, lots of languages to learn, in any case.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>I'll stick with English for now. It's time to wrap up.</p><p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>OK.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>So let's remember some of the words we explained today.</p><p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>They were:</p><p>rusty </p><p>playground </p><p>marks </p><p>integration </p><p>nursery </p><p>head teacher </p><p>educational standards </p><p>assessed </p><p>caught up </p><p>bilingual</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong><em>Merci beaucoup</em>.

But you might not thank me for it after the programme.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Why's that?</p><p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Because a paper published by the British Medical Journal says that laughter is not always the best medicine, and sometimes, it can actually be harmful.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, in that case I definitely won't be laughing at your jokes any more! And, to be honest, it wasn't funny anyway.</p><p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Anyway, today we'll be exploring the connection between laughter and health, and looking at some health-related vocabulary. But before we get into the story, Neil: a question. You're a parent. At what age do babies begin to laugh? Is it:</p><p>a) 0-3 months</p><p>b) 3-6 months</p><p>c) 6-8 months</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Right I'm pretty sure, unless my memory is very bad, that it's a) 0-3 months.</p><p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>OK, well, we will find out if you're right at the end of the programme. OK, so laughter, as I said, is generally thought of as a good thing. There's a phrase I said earlier which is: <strong style=""font-size: 12px;"">laughter is the best medicine</strong>.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Yes, and talking of medicine, there are many medical studies which examine the benefits of laughter - it reduces stress, it's good for your heart, things like that. But now you're telling me it can have some negative effects?</p><p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Well, why don't we listen to Professor Robin Ferner, who is one of the authors of the research paper. How many negative effects of laughter does he mention?</p><p><strong>INSERT<br clear=""none""/></strong><strong>Robin Ferner, University of Birmingham<br clear=""none""/></strong>We found people with heart rhythm disturbance which had stopped their heart, we found people who had fainted, we found people whose gullets had burst, we found people who'd dislocated their jaws or burst their lungs.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Quite a few! It seems laughing can be<strong style=""font-size: 12px;""> no laughing matter!</strong><strong style=""font-size: 12px;""> </strong></p><p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Indeed - he mentions five problems caused by laughter, including heart rhythm disturbance, fainting, burst gullets, dislocated jaws and even burst lungs.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Some of those sound quite nasty.<strong style=""font-size: 12px;""> Fainting</strong> is when you lose consciousness and pass out; and your<strong style=""font-size: 12px;""> gullet</strong> is the tube through which food passes from the mouth to the stomach, so a burst gullet would be horrible.</p><p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>I think it would be very bad! We also heard about burst <strong style=""font-size: 12px;"">lungs</strong> - lungs are the organs in your chest that you use to breathe. And - I think you'd have to be laughing really hard to do this - to get a <strong style=""font-size: 12px;"">dislocated jaw</strong>. To dislocate something is to move it out of its normal place or position, so you dis-locate it. A dislocated jaw - ouch.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, thankfully there is no danger of dislocated jaws with your jokes Finn!</p><p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>OK! Well, in fact, these five dangers are only some that were mentioned in the study.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>But surely, there must have been some positive findings?</p><p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Yes, let's listen to Professor Robin Ferner again - which health benefit does he mention?</p><p><strong>INSERT<br clear=""none""/></strong><strong>Robin Ferner, University of Birmingham<br clear=""none""/></strong>You actually use energy when you laugh, you move your diaphragm, you expand your lungs, and both those things can be helpful. For example, it's said that laughing for quarter of an hour will burn up 40 kcal, and if you laughed all day you'd use up about 2,000 calories.</p><p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>That's more like it! Laughing can help you lose weight, because you use energy when you laugh.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>In fact, quite a lot of energy: if you laughed all day you'd use 2,000 calories, which is what most people consume in a day.</p><p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>He also thinks laughing makes people feel better, and it can reduce the chance of having a <strong style=""font-size: 12px;"">heart attack</strong>.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>So overall - what's the story - laughing: good or bad?</p><p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Well, he says for most people, most of the time, laughing is a great thing. And well, that's good, because I like to laugh, don't you Neil?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Oh yes I do.</p><p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Earlier I asked you Neil, at what age do babies begin to laugh? Was it 0-3 months, 3-6 months or 6-8 months?</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>And I said 0-3 months.</p><p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Well, Neil, the answer was in fact b) 3-6 months. A little bit later! And 0-3 months, which was your answer, Neil, is when babies smile for the first time.</p><p><strong>Neil<br/></strong>Well, you <strong style=""font-size: 12px;"">had the last laugh</strong> there Finn.</p><p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Very good - and if you have the last laugh it means you're successful in the end.

You don't mean the one in the sky, of course.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>No.</p><p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>You mean the huge computers where companies like Apple, Facebook and Google store their users' pictures, videos and documents.

They were leaked to the public.

Privacy means being free from public attention. And in this programme you'll hear useful words for giving your opinion on this subject.</p><p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Yes. The celebrities were very angry.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>They thought they could keep their pictures private because they were in the cloud protected by a <strong style=""font-size: 12px;"">password </strong>- a word or sequence of numbers that only they knew and which is required for them to gain access to what is stored in their name.</p><p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>The US federal police - that's the FBI - have been investigating this to find the <strong style=""font-size: 12px;"">hackers</strong> involved.

Right. Let's talk more about privacy online. People are more and more concerned about it. Listen to the advice internet expert Oliver Crofton gives us.

If you have a private or sensitive photograph, or a contract or some sort of document that has public interest and that people will want to try and get, just think twice about putting it into an environment such as a Cloud, of which you don't really have any control over.</p><p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>He says people have to be 'savvy' - now, that means well-informed and quite shrewd, you know, thinking carefully about things. He advises us to be very careful before putting documents and pictures onto these websites owned by big corporations.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes, because he says we don't have any control over their computers - you don't know how secure your documents are.</p><p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Yeah, you know Rob, I can see why people are suspicious of these things.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Well, let's see what the BBC technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones has to say. Rory explains howsome cloud companies are offering to make the cloud more secure. Which word does he use to describe this kind of security process and it also means 'identification of the user'?</p><p><strong>INSERT<br/></strong><strong style=""font-size: 12px;"">Rory Cellan-Jones, BBC technology correspondent<br/></strong>Many cloud companies now offer an added layer of security called 'two-factor <strong style=""font-size: 12px;"">authentication</strong>', where users have to enter a code sent to their mobile phone as well as a password to get into their accounts.</p><p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>OK, the word was 'authentication' - now, that's confirmation that someone is who they say they are. And the company actually uses two steps to do this.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes. After you try to access your account, they send a code - probably a series of numbers - to your mobile phone, so it's an extra bit of information that only you know.</p><p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>We really all should be very careful about how we protect our computers, and our tablets and our smartphones, things like that.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Talking about smartphones, let's go back to my question. </p><p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>OK.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>I asked you how many people had mobile phones in 2013. Was it: 1.4 million people, 14 million people, or 1.4 billion people?</p><p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>And I said 1.4 billion - the big one.</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>And you are correct! </p><p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>OK!</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Yes, by the end of 2013, about 1.4 billion people owned and used smartphones and by the end of 2014 this number will increase by 25% - this is according to the research company eMarketer.</p><p><strong>Finn<br/></strong>Wow!

Many websites are bringing people together to do just that as part of what's called 'the sharing economy'., 27 Nov 2014,,Transcript,"<p>Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Finn, and Rob's here too.</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>Yes, hello.</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>Hi. Rob - tell me - do you have a spare room in your house?</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>Absolutely not. We're full to capacity in our house.</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>And what about a <strong>driveway</strong> for your car?</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>A driveway - so you mean a parking space off the road at my house? Not exactly a driveway, but yes I do have a parking space, yes.</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>Well - both of these are ways of making money in the 'sharing economy'. Interested? Well, we'll be talking about this new economy in the programme, and learning some language related to making money. But first - a question.<strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>Great. I don't have to pay for it do I?</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>It's a free question. But no prize either. In February 2014, Britain's most expensive parking space went on sale, but for how much? Was it:</p><p>a) £80,000</p><p>b) £100,000 </p><p>c) £400,000</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>Well, it's just a parking space isn't it? So I'm going to go for the lowest value: £80,000.</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>£80,000 - still a lot of money. We'll find out if that's the right answer at the end of the programme. But first, let's find out a bit more about this sharing economy. Rob, are you <strong>feeling the pinch</strong>? </p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>Feeling the pinch - you mean feeling poor. Yes, I'm always feeling the pinch. So come on Finn, tell us how we can make some money. </p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>Well, perhaps the best-known example of a company in the sharing economy is Airbnb - it's an American web business which allows you to rent out your spare room to <strong>holidaymakers</strong>.</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>OK. Holidaymakers - so these are people on holiday. Using your spare room as a B and B - that's a bed and breakfast?</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>Yes - you can provide breakfast for your guests too... </p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>That sounds like a clever way to <strong>make a few pennies</strong>. </p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>Yes, to make a few pennies - to make a bit of extra money. </p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>OK well, Airbnb say they operate in 34,000 cities and have 800,000 listings of rooms and apartments. In fact, we could say they're the <strong>market-leader </strong>in this industry - the main, most successful company. </p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>There are many companies doing very similar things. And one doing something with parking spaces is JustPark. It's a British business that lets you rent out your driveway or parking space. </p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>Another way to make money <strong>on the side</strong> - which means to make some extra money in addition to your normal job. We're going to hear from the founder of JustPark now, Anthony Eskinazi. Where did the idea for the business come from?</p><p><strong>Anthony Eskinazi, founder of JustPark<br clear=""none""/></strong>When I had the original idea, I spotted a driveway close to a sports stadium. It would have been so convenient if I could have just parked in that driveway rather than in a <strong>commercial </strong>car park.<em> </em></p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>So, Anthony said that he got the idea when trying to park near a stadium. He said he saw a driveway. He thought it would be more convenient to just park there than in a commercial car park - a normal one which makes money. </p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>So he set up this site. And around 20,000 people have put their spaces on the site, and he says around half a million drivers use it. </p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>Interestingly, a church near Kings Cross in central London has apparently made over £200,000 by renting out space in its yard to travellers!<strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>And of course there are other sites doing very similar things, like Uber and Lyft - these let drivers share their cars with other passengers. </p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>And there's even a company in Hong Kong which lets you share space under your umbrella when it rains! </p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>That sounds like <strong>one for a rainy day</strong>.</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>Haha - an idea to store away until you need it. But I do have a question. What about the people who run things like traditional B and Bs, or commercial car parks - or taxi services - things like that? Won't they be <strong>out of pocket</strong>?</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>Out of pocket, yes - lose money. Many of them are out of pocket and are not happy about this. And there is another issue: <strong>regulations</strong> - or laws. Listen to the editor of <em>Tech City News</em>, Alex Wood. Why are regulations for these new businesses unclear?</p><p><strong>Alex Wood, editor of Tech City News<br clear=""none""/></strong>Take the example of someone who has a driveway in their house. They've got some spare capacity there - they're looking to make some more money. But how does that affect their neighbours? How does that affect the Council and the regulation and the rules around them? Because this is a new business world, those rules aren't there yet.</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>Well, he says they're unclear - because the rules aren't there yet. Because it's a whole new business world.</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>In fact, Airbnb has had problems with the law. But, in a time when the economy is doing badly, these businesses seem to be <strong>thriving</strong> - doing really well - and provide an extra <strong>source of income</strong> for many people.</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>That's right. Many are benefitting from this new economy. But others are out of pocket. That's business. Rob, what about us? Could you make some money from this sharing economy? You could rent out your bike - your lovely folding bike - while you're at work?</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>That's a really good idea - it's kind of a downtime, the bike's not being used, so why not! Anyway - how about the answer to today's question?<strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>Yes, earlier I asked you about the most expensive parking space ever to go on sale in London. How much was it on sale for?</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>Well, I had a guess and I said £80,000.</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>Well, you were completely wrong. It was the most expensive one: £400,000. </p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>No way! For a parking space!</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>It was a space in London, in Kensington and it went on sale for £400,000, which is over twice the price of the average UK house. So very expensive! Anyway, Rob, before we go any further, how about those words again? </p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>OK, the words we've heard today were:</p><p>driveway</p><p>feeling the pinch</p><p>holidaymakers</p><p>make a few pennies</p><p>on the side</p><p>market leader</p><p>one for a rainy day</p><p>out of pocket</p><p>regulations</p><p>thriving</p><p>source of income</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>Thank you Rob.

Rob's here today. Hi Rob.</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>Hello Finn – are you well?</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>Very well, thanks. Rob, tell me – do you have a favourite <strong>science-fiction</strong> movie?</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>Ahh, science fiction – stories about an imagined future … well my favourite was and always will be <em>ET: Extra Terrestrial</em>, and you Finn?</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>Mine would probably be <em>Blade Runner</em> – the movie with Harrison Ford set in a dark, scary Los Angeles where he hunts robots called replicants. You know the one?</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>I do – and come to think of it, lots of movies and stories about the future are quite dark and negative …</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>But perhaps this might change. A new project wants to use the power of science fiction to do something very different: to inspire people to create a better future. It sounds very grand. We'll be discussing the project and learning some language to talk about the future in this programme.</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>But before we get <em>too</em> far into the future, I'm sure you have a question for me, Finn?</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>Yes indeed. It's about the film <em>Blade Runner</em>. It's set in the future – but in which year?</p><p>a)    2000</p><p>b)    2019</p><p>c)    2056</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>I think I'm gonna go for the far future, c) 2056.</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>Well I'll tell you if you're right or wrong later <strong>in the not-too-distant future</strong>.</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>Very good. So, as we were saying: lots of science fiction is negative.</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>Yes, there's a word to describe the kind of future world which often appears in science fiction: <strong>dystopian</strong>. The noun 'dystopia' means an imagined place where things are unpleasant or bad. The opposite is <strong>utopia</strong> and <strong>utopian</strong>.</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>But why is so much science fiction dystopian? Dr Braden Allenby from Arizona State University.</p><p><strong>Braden Allenby, Professor of Engineering and Ethics, Arizona State University</strong></p><p>The <strong>downside</strong> of both of science fiction and movies is that they tend to be dystopian, they tend to be very negative, they tend to be very noir. Dystopian is easier to do. It's easier to write a dystopian story than it is to write an optimistic story.</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>He says dystopian stories are easier to write. I can see that – there's more conflict in a world which has problems – and good stories often have a lot of conflict and problems to resolve.</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>Yes, but Braden thinks being negative is the downside of science fiction. A downside is a disadvantage, a bad point. He would prefer to see more <strong>optimistic</strong> science fiction.</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>Optimistic, more positive about the future, which is why Braden is taking part in something called Project Hieroglyph. It brings together writers, scientists, engineers and artists to create optimistic stories about things which really could happen in the next 50 years.</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>So let's talk about the kinds of things are happening in these stories?</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>Well, there's one about a huge tower 20 km tall – going all the way into space. Apparently, building the tower is good for the US steel industry … and they invent a new kind of energy in the story too.</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>Sounds very interesting – but is it <strong>plausible</strong> – could it really happen? Could they really build a tower that big?</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>Well, there's another about <strong>environmentalists</strong> who fight to stop people building the first hotel in Antarctica.</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>Environmentalists – people who care about the environment. Well there's conflict there … and it's plausible, so it could be a good story. But I can't help thinking – will these stories actually change anything?</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>Ed Finn, who edited a book of these stories, thinks so. He says: ""A good science-fiction story can be very powerful"". ""It can inspire hundreds, thousands, millions of people to <strong>rally around</strong> something that they want to do.""</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>To rally around something means to come together in support of a cause.</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>And Braden Allenby says you can already see the influence of science fiction in modern research. Which item is being worked on right now?</p><p><strong>Braden Allenby, Professor of Engineering and Ethics, Arizona State University</strong></p><p>""Why are people working on, for example, invisibility cloaks? Well, it's Harry Potter, right? That's where they saw it.""</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>An invisibility cloak – a long coat which makes you <strong>invisible,</strong> in other words unable to be seen – which people first saw in one of the <em>Harry Potter</em> movies.</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>Interesting … so will the stories from Project Hieroglyph inspire people to do and invent new things that can help others? Can they help create <strong>a</strong> <strong>bright future</strong> – that's a good, positive future? Or will they just be good stories?</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong><strong>Time will tell</strong> – that means we'll find out as time goes by. One thing that we're going to find out right now is the answer to when the movie <em>Blade Runner</em> was set?</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>I said the answer was c) 2056.</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>And the answer was in fact b) 2019. A little bit earlier, Rob.</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>Quite soon, then?</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>Yes, it's in a couple of years. So, watch out LA. But, Rob, can you remind us of some of the words we learned today?</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>We had …</p><p>science fiction</p><p>dystopian</p><p>downside</p><p>optimistic</p><p>plausible</p><p>a bright future</p><p>time will tell</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>And that's it for today's programme.

I'm Rob …</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>… and hello, I'm Finn.</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>Now Finn, there is nothing I like more than <strong>tucking into</strong> a juicy steak, munching on a hamburger or chewing on a nice piece of roast beef.</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>It does sound good, doesn't it? But meat eaters, like us, might need to think again about the amount we eat.</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>That's right because in the programme today we're discussing how eating meat can add to the problem of <strong>greenhouse gas</strong>.</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>Greenhouse gas is a type of gas that stops heat escaping from the atmosphere and causes a greenhouse effect – it warms up our planet – and that leads to climate change.</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>Yes, that's it's not a good thing. We have heard in the past about greenhouse gas being caused by pollution from factories…</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>… and from using containers of things like paint or perfume, which is kept under high pressure so that it can be sprayed – we call these aerosols.</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>But according to a recent report, the production of meat is also adding to the problem. We'll talk more about this soon and looking at some related vocabulary, but not before we've set today's question. Are you ready, Finn?</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>Ready and waiting, Rob.</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>According to a study in America, how many tonnes of beef is produced globally every year?</p><p>a)    59 million tonnes</p><p>b)    69 million tonnes</p><p>c)    79 million tonnes</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>Let's go supersize and say 79 million tonnes.</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>I'll let you know the answer at the end of the programme. Let's continue our discussion about the link between meat and greenhouse gases.</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>Research from Cambridge and Aberdeen universities estimates greenhouse gases from food production will go up 80% if meat and dairy <strong>consumption</strong> continues to rise at its current rate. 'Consumption' here means the process of eating food.</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>So more and more of us are eating meat – there is a surge. Let's find out exactly why from BBC Environment Analyst, Roger Harrabin. See if you can hear why meat production is causing the problem …</p><p><strong>INSERT<br/>BBC Environment Analyst, Roger Harrabin<br/></strong>The surge in meat eating will drive more deforestation as farmers seek increasing amounts of land, the study says. Cutting forests releases greenhouse gases from the wood and the soil, and fertilisers create greenhouse gases too. The report says under current trends, agriculture alone will cause the world to bust its targets for reducing the risk of dangerous climate change.</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>So eating more meat means farmers need more land to keep their animals on. And to get more land, they need to cut down trees – which is called <strong>deforestation</strong>.</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>It's deforestation – cutting down forests – that causes greenhouse gases from wood and soil to be released. And there's another reason too – the use of <strong>fertilisers</strong>.</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>These are natural or chemical substances added to the soil to help plants grow. Like these plants, used to feed the animals.</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>And another problem is that more of the fields used for growing crops that we eat, like wheat, are being used to grow food to feed the animals that we later eat!</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>Research has also found beef cattle need 28 times more land than pork, poultry or dairy farming.</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>So it's a big problem, but many of us have an <strong>appetite</strong> – a need or interest – for meat. Especially for <strong>carnivores. </strong>Carnivores are really animals that just eat meat but we refer to humans as carnivores too sometimes because they just love meat. Something else is tempting us too.</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>Yes, something is encouraging us to eat more. See if you can hear what it is in the next part of Roger Harribin's report…</p><p><strong>INSERT<br/>BBC Environment Analyst, Roger Harrabin<br/></strong>The real challenge is the public's appetite. There's a burger restaurant boom in major cities. People are voting with their bellies and it's not normally mushroom burgers they're after!</p><p><strong>Rob<br/></strong>Some interesting language there. He described the increase in burger restaurants as a<strong> 'boom'</strong> – so a major increase. And he said people are voting with their bellies …</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>A nice phrase – he means, people are showing they like burger restaurants by going to them and eating more.</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>And they're not buying burgers made of vegetables or things like mushroom burgers – they're buying and eating meat, like beef burgers.</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>Well, with meat consumption predicted to double in the next 40 years as people globally get wealthier, it's a problem that's not going to go away.</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>A bit like today's question – today's question was, according to a scientific study in America, how many tonnes of beef is produced globally every year?</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>I said c) 79 million tonnes.</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>That's a lot to eat but you are wrong. The answer is 59 million tonnes. This is according to the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. It also found cattle are the biggest source of greenhouse gases, accounting for more than three-quarters of all gases made by farming livestock around the world. Well before we chew over that fact, Finn could you please remind us of some of the words we have heard today?</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>Ok:</p><p>tucking into</p><p>greenhouse gas</p><p>consumption</p><p>deforestation</p><p>fertiliser</p><p>appetite</p><p>carnivore</p><p>boom</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>Well, that brings us to the end of today's 6 Minute English.

I'm Rob... and... is it a bird? Is it a plane? No, it's Super-Finn!</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>Hello Rob - it's just Finn here actually - I'm no <strong>superhero</strong>!</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>That's a shame. So you don't have any special <strong>superpowers </strong>- amazing skills and abilities that can be used for saving people and fighting against evil?</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>Well, lots of powers, but no superpowers. I'm afraid not. Superheroes, of course, tend to be <strong>fictional</strong> characters – they're made-up characters, who appear in comics and books and movies.</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>You mean characters like Batman, Spiderman and Wonder Woman. Do you have a favourite?</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>I do actually. Spiderman was my favourite when I was growing up. And he can climb up walls and I really wanted to do the same - I tried to climb up the walls in my house and sadly I failed because superheroes are fictional - they aren't real!</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>Well some real-life superheroes do exist and that's what we'll be talking about today and we'll be explaining some words related to superheroes. But first a question...</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>Can I use my superpowers to answer this one?</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>You can try. What year did Superman first appear published in a comic book?</p><p>a)    1930</p><p>b)    1934</p><p>c)    1938</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>My <em>spidey</em> sense tells me it's 1934.</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>I'll tell you if you're right or wrong at the end of the programme. Now let's find out more about some real-life superheroes. These are people who don't really have superpowers but they are doing something <strong>extraordinary</strong>.</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>So they are doing something special - but most importantly, they are doing something good.</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>People often describe someone who has done something brave, such as saving someone's life, as a hero. Firefighters are sometimes described as heroes because they often risk their lives to save others.</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>But heroes don't have to be <strong>life-savers</strong>. We sometimes describe a person with great intelligence or amazing abilities as 'our hero' - a musician maybe or an athlete. It's someone we <strong>admire</strong> and look up to.</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>Well there's a man in Japan who's recently been described as a 'superhero'. To be honest, I don't think his powers are superhuman - that means a power that ordinary humans don't have - but what he does is rather unusual and he gives up his free time doing it.</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>Tell me more Rob.</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>This is Chibatman - named after the city of Chiba where he comes from. His <strong>mission</strong> - his purpose - is to make the people of the city happy.</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>That's a worthwhile mission.</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>It is. Chibatman has been spotted 'flying' through the streets of Chiba dressed a bit like Batman and riding his custom-built three-wheeled Chibatpod. But why? Is he just a bit crazy or does he have <strong>honourable</strong> intentions?</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>You mean does he genuinely want to do good things and make things better?</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>Well, listen to what he says, speaking through a translator, and see if you can hear what his reasons are …  </p><p><strong>INSERT<br clear=""none""/>'Chibatman' - Chiba superhero<br clear=""none""/></strong>I started doing this around three years ago. As for my reasons: during the great earthquake people forgot how to smile. I wanted to help bring the smile back and that's why I started.</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>OK, so because of the devastation caused by the earthquake and tsunami in 2011, he felt people had forgotten how to smile. So his mission was to get people smiling again. That's something we could describe as being 'honourable'.</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>What is interesting about him and other superheroes is they keep their identity <strong>closely-guarded</strong> - nobody knows who the real man in the costume is.</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>That's also true for another Japanese man who's been called a superhero. Mr Full Moon wears a costume to hide his identity when he goes around cleaning the streets of Tokyo.</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>Yes, he actually talks to people through a voice on his smartphone. He hasn't been employed by anyone to do this ­- he just claims he wants to keep the city's streets cleaner. We could call him a grime fighter armed with a dustpan and brush!</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>Very good - a 'grime fighter' - someone fighting dirt and dust!</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>Anyway, time now to see if your superpowers helped you answer today's question correctly.</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>Yes Rob, you asked me what year Superman first appeared in a comic book.</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>And you said 1934 and you were wrong. Superman first appeared in Action Comics #1 in June 1938. The character was created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster and originally he wasn't a hero but a villain - the bad guy - but he was changed into a hero before he was published in the comic.</p><p>Now before you change into your costume, could you save the day by reminding us of some of the words we have heard today?</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>Yes, today we heard:</p><p>superhero</p><p>superpowers</p><p>fictional</p><p>extraordinary</p><p>life-savers</p><p>admire</p><p>mission</p><p>honourable</p><p>closely-guarded</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>Well, that brings us to the end of today's 6 Minute English.

Just thinking about it makes me want to cough (coughs again).</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>It's because you are a <strong>secondary smoker</strong> – in other words, you're someone who doesn't smoke but breathes in the smoke from someone else's cigarette. And this smoke is very harmful to your health. So, here is today's question, Finn.</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>OK, go ahead.</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>According to the World Health Organisation, there are more than 4,000 chemicals in cigarette smoke. How many of these are known to be harmful to our health? Is it at least:</p><p>a)    50</p><p>b)    150</p><p>c)    250</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>Mm … Let me think. (he guesses)?</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>You'll get the answer at the end of the programme. Well, electronic cigarettes are everywhere now. Some estimates say more than a million people are using e-cigarettes just in the UK. But these devices might not be very safe for secondary smokers …</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>Is that so? I thought they were okay because they produce vapour rather than the smoke full of harmful chemicals you get in ordinary cigarettes.</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>Well, the World Health Organisation is not convinced e-cigarettes are any safer to secondary smokers. It has recommended a <strong>ban</strong> on the use of electronic cigarettes indoors and their sale to people under 18 years old.</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>A ban? In other words, they don't want them to be permitted indoors anymore? I know that e-cigarettes work by heating liquid <strong>nicotine</strong> – this is the substance in tobacco which makes it addictive. It turns into vapour which is inhaled by the smoker. I thought because it was just vapour, it was okay for non-smokers!</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>It's vapour with some chemicals in it. And experts fear it could have similar effects to the smoke produced by ordinary cigarettes. Listen to what Professor John Ashton has to say. He's from the Faculty of Public Health here in the UK. Which words does he use to describe the use of e-cigarettes for an extended period of time?</p><p> </p><p><strong>INSERT<br clear=""none"">Professor John Ashton, from the Faculty of Public Health in the UK<br clear=""none""/></br></strong>There are scientists in America who've been studying second-hand effects of tobacco smoke who are raising these issues now about the e-cigarettes. And we really can't allow these things to get establishedbefore we know what the <strong>long-term </strong>effects are going to be. </p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>He talks aboutlong-termeffects. He means that the constant use of e-cigarettes for an extended period of time might cause harm which we are not aware of yet.</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>You can't light up a cigarette in a pub or bar anymore. It was the effect of people's cigarette smoke on other staff that led to the ban on ordinary cigarettes in Britain. Private companies and the authorities are keen not to risk bringing back any kind of smoking to closed spaces in public places.</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>This is likely to annoymany smokers who have been moving to electronic cigarettes in an attempt to cut down on nicotine or even <strong>quit smoking</strong>.</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>Yes, many people want to quit smoking ­ – stop smoking – at once. And they find it easier to do this if they can use e-cigarettes. In the last few decades smokers have been feeling persecuted.</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>Yes, there's a lot of pressure for them to quit the habit.</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>Listen to what this smoker who uses e-cigarettes has to say.He's in a pub in Bristol. Which word does he use to talk about the harm certain things do to children?</p><p><strong>INSERT<br clear=""none"">Male customer, Bristol pub<br clear=""none""/></br></strong>We react at absolutely everything in this world. What we'll gonna have eventually though is 'no drinking beer' in pubs because it's <strong>damaging </strong>for children to watch it happening.</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>He uses the word 'damaging', meaning harmful. He complains that there's an <strong>overreaction</strong> to things like cigarettes and alcohol.</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>Yes. An 'overreaction' means responding to something in a way which is more forceful than required. He complained that one day the authorities might end up banning people from drinking alcohol in pubs. Pubs, as we know, are bars to which most customers go to drink alcohol.</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>He is using some irony here.</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>Yes. The right to smoke or not smoke generates passionate debates. Smoking is bad for your health, but some people argue that eating junk food is bad too but it's still available all over the place.</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>Cigarettes are addictive and it's very difficult for people just to give them up.</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>But here are some facts which might make people think again. I told you earlier in the programme that there are more than 4,000 chemicals in cigarette smoke. And I asked you how many of these are known to be harmful to health. The options were: at least 50, 150 or 250?</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>I said 250. Is it as many as that, Rob?</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>It is as many as that.</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>Wow!</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>Yes, at least 250. Acording to the World Health Organisation website, it says that more than 50 chemicals in tobacco smoke are known to cause cancer. Any amount of second hand tobaco smoke is thought to be unsafe, and second hand smoke causes more that 600,000 early deaths per year. Well, as we are nearly the end of the programme, let's just remember some of the words we used today. Finn?</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>We heard:</p><p>cough</p><p>secondary smoker</p><p>ban</p><p>nicotine</p><p>long-term</p><p>quit smoking</p><p>damaging</p><p>overreaction</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>Thanks Finn. Well that's it for this programme.

Rob and Neil talk about the recent recommendation by the World Health Organisation for people to reduce the amount of sugar they eat even more than previously advised. They say that it should account for 5% of the total energy we take from food – down from 10%., 141023 	 23 Oct 2014,,Transcript,"<p>Note: This is not a word for word transcript</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>Hello I'm Rob. Welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm joined today by Neil.</p><p><strong>Neil<br clear=""none""/></strong>Hello. Neil here. Excuse me I'm enjoying a bar of chocolate…</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>Where did you get that from?</p><p><strong>Neil<br clear=""none""/></strong>In the <strong>vending machine</strong> upstairs – that's the automatic machine with drinks and sweets – you put coins in it to release whatever you paid for.</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>Now, if it was up to some health professionals, you wouldn't see many of those machines around anymore.</p><p><strong>Neil<br clear=""none""/></strong>What? No more machines which offer you as many sweets as you like, no questions asked?</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>Exactly. The World Health Organisation has recently proposed a cut in its recommendation for how much sugar we should have. They now say that it should be less than 5% of our<strong> calorie intake</strong>.</p><p><strong>Neil<br clear=""none""/></strong>A<strong> calorie </strong>is a unit that measures how much energy you get from food, and calorie intake is how many calories we eat in a period of time – say a day, for example.</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>Yes. So this might be it for sugar for you today, Neil.</p><p><strong>Neil<br clear=""none""/></strong>Well, let me see… this bar of chocolate contains 215 calories! That's quite a lot, isn't it?</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>But life can be sweet even with less sugar, Neil. So today, we're going to talk about what should be done to help us eat less sugar and you'll learn words about food.</p><p><strong>Neil<br clear=""none""/></strong>But I like my sugar!</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>Many people do. So let me ask you about how much they like it. Which country has the highest sugar consumption? Is it:</p><p>a)    China</p><p>b)    India</p><p>c)    The United States</p><p><strong>Neil<br clear=""none""/></strong>I think it's the United States.</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>Okay. Well, we'll have the answer at the end of the programme! Right, so let's talk about sugar. Health experts are looking for ways to make us eat less of it.</p><p><strong>Neil<br clear=""none""/></strong>We all know that too much sugar can cause not only obesity and diabetes but also <strong>tooth decay</strong> – this destroys the hard surface of your teeth and exposes more sensitive parts. Ouch!</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>Yes, it can be very painful. You might enjoy eating sweets but nobody likes <strong>toothache</strong> – that's what we call the pain in your teeth.</p><p><strong>Neil<br clear=""none""/></strong>Experts say we should always brush our teeth after eating sugary food.  </p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>Yes. Aubrey Sheiham, Professor of Dental Public Health at University College London, goes even further. He is part of a team which is suggesting the authorities in England reduce the number of vending machines in public places. Listen to what he says. Which word does he use to describe Neil's chocolate bar and other kinds of wrapped sweets?</p><p><strong>INSERT<br clear=""none""/>Aubrey Sheiham, Professor of Dental Public Health at University College London<br clear=""none""/></strong>We shouldn't have vending machines with <strong>confectionery </strong>and <strong>soft drinks</strong> in any publicly-funded institutions – no schools, nurseries, hospitals etc. – and also limit the amount of sugar in school meals, nurseries' meals. That again would be a first step that one would take.</p><p><strong>Neil<br clear=""none""/></strong>He mentions 'confectionery', meaning chocolate and sweet snacks, which can be bought from vending machines, along with soft drinks – which are cold sweet drinks that are not alcoholic.</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>The professor doesn't want these machines in state schools or hospitals. And he also wants meals served to children in schools to have less sugar.</p><p><strong>Neil<br clear=""none""/></strong>He's got a point there. We get used to sugar in childhood. And it seems that the more sugar we eat, the more we want. But if we get used to eating things which are less sweet, after a while when we eat something very sweet, it doesn't taste so good. Do you understand what I mean?</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>Yes, I do. It's a matter of habit. We don't need so much sugar to enjoy the sweet taste. But the professor says there's another way of encouraging us to eat less sugar. Aubrey Sheiham talks about tax on sugar. France has already adopted a sugar tax. Where's the money being spent? Let's listen.</p><p><strong>INSERT<br clear=""none""/></strong><strong>Aubrey Sheiham, Professor of Dental Public Health at University College London<br clear=""none""/></strong>You've got a lot of public support in France where the consumption of sugar has gone down considerably. And, what is good about what the French have done is that tax that has gone on sugar is being spent in the <strong>health service</strong>. This is a way that you could actually use that money from the sugar tax and spend it on improving health care and dental care.</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>He says it's being spent on the health service. This is the doctors' surgeries and hospitals financed with public money – money paid to a government in the form of taxes.</p><p><strong>Neil<br clear=""none""/></strong>Oh, so chocolate might become more expensive! Not so good for me because I <strong>have a sweet tooth</strong>…</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>Ah a sweet tooth, yeah, like me – a strong preference for sweet food. Well, people with a sweet tooth should be careful or they might end up with toothache.  </p><p><strong>Neil<br clear=""none""/></strong>I care a lot about my teeth.</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>Good on you. You've got a fine set of gnashers there. Okay, let's go back to our quiz. I asked you which country has the highest sugar consumption. The options were: China, India and the United States.</p><p><strong>Neil<br clear=""none""/></strong>And I said the United States.</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>And Neil, you are wrong. The correct answer is actually India. According to a report issued by the US Department of Agriculture in 2012, India was the country with the highest consumption of sugar. Then we had China and the country in this list which ate the least amount of sugar is the United States.  These countries are also amongst the largest producers of sugar. Okay. Well, now our time is up. Let's remember some of the words we explained today.</p><p><strong>Neil<br clear=""none""/></strong>Yes. They were:</p><p>vending machine</p><p>calorie intake</p><p>calorie</p><p>tooth decay</p><p>toothache</p><p>confectionery</p><p>soft drinks</p><p>health service</p><p>to have a sweet tooth</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>Thanks, Neil.

Welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm joined today by Finn. Hi Finn.</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>Hello Rob. </p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>Today we're talking about something we have some <strong>expertise</strong> in or knowledge about. That's teaching English.</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>That's right Rob. We work on the BBC's Learning English website - hopefully giving people around the world <strong>a helping hand</strong> in learning a language that isn't the one they usually use.</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>Well hopefully we're about to make that learning journey a bit easier as we launch a brand new online course. But how long does it take someone to become a <strong>fluent</strong> speaker of English?</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>A good question Rob and one we'll try to answer today. We'll also be discussing some general ways to make learning English easier and explaining some learning-related vocabulary along the way. So let's get started Rob.   </p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>Hold your horses Finn – not so fast! I have a question to ask you first. According the last UK census taken in 2011, what percentage of the British population speaks a first language that is not English?</p><p>a)    1.7%</p><p>b)    7.7%</p><p>c)    14.7%</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>That's an interesting one. My first guess is c) 14.7%.</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>We'll find out if you are right or wrong later. So now we can discuss how learning English is getting easier. Of course there are a huge number of publications – books, leaflets and magazines – that can help teach you but there are those people who say that you can't beat the real thing – a teacher. Someone who can explain a language to you <strong>face-to-face</strong>.  </p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>Yes but that comes at a cost and isn't always practical – you might not have a school nearby. That's why in the 21st Century, online seems to be the main method of learning. Technology is allowing the English language to come to you!</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>That's true and that's why we've launched a brand new English course that's available on a computer, tablet or mobile phone. It's aimed at intermediate learners and charts a <strong>pathway</strong> through the various aspects of the language.</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>We hope that by committing around 15 minutes a day to using it, a learner will see a real improvement in their English knowledge and skill. But as well as using the <strong>resources </strong>available online, how else can someone help themselves to get a better <strong>grasp</strong> – a better understanding - of English?</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>Well if someone wants to become a confident speaker of English, trainer Richard Hallows has some tips. Have a listen and see if you can hear what are the two main aspects of English that you need.</p><p><strong>INSERT<br clear=""none"">Richard Hallows – trainer in speaking English <br clear=""none""/></br></strong>Most importantly, you've got to have a a good range of vocabulary and grammar. You need to know lots of words, the more words you know the better, obviously. And similarly with grammar, the more grammar you have the better you can explain yourself. We also need to think about pronunciation - learners of English often worry about speaking like a native speaker… it's not necessary to have a native accent.<em> </em></p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>OK, so Richard says you need a good range – or a wide variety - of vocabulary and grammar. The more words you know the more you can say – and the more grammar you know, the better you can say it…</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>Or even write it! One other tip is don't try to sound like a <strong>native</strong> – so someone who speaks English as a first language. All these are things we aim to cover in our new course.</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>Our new course might be a big help to you if you need English for your work, or if you're studying in English, or if you're planning to visit or even live in the UK. The British government expects immigrants to reach ESOL Entry 3 or B1 level, before they can be granted citizenship. It's equivalent to being able to hold a reasonably confident basic conversation.</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>Well in the UK it's estimated that you need around 360 hours of study to get to that stage from not knowing any English at all.  But this depends on a number of factors such as <strong>motivation</strong> – how much you want to learn.</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>And age can be a factor. Some experts say it's common for children under the age of 11 to be very immersed and be fluent in English in about six months. But why should someone choose to learn English? This is something we've been asking you on our Facebook page.<strong><br clear=""none""/></strong></p><p><strong>Finn              <br clear=""none""/></strong>Oussama says: ""It's like my passport. You need it wherever you go.""</p><p><strong>Rob            <br clear=""none""/></strong>Suzuki says: ""It is an international communication tool.""</p><p><strong>Finn               <br clear=""none""/></strong>Ha thinks it's: ""The key to getting a good job with a high salary.""</p><p><strong>Rob               <br clear=""none""/></strong>And Denis says: ""It's the language that opens doors overseas."" Thanks for all of your messages.</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>But now Rob, I need to know if I got today's question right.</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>Yes. I asked you, according the last UK census taken in 2011, what percentage of the British population speaks a first language that is not English?</p><p><strong>Finn               <br clear=""none""/></strong>I said 14.7%.</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>You were wrong. The census found 7.7% per cent of people in the UK have a first language that is not English. That's 4.2 million people.</p><p>Well, that's it for today.

I'm Rob…</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>… and I'm Finn. Hello.</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>Hello, Finn. Now, you like food don't you?</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>Yes, I do.</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>But how much of it do you actually throw away?</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>Probably too much although I'm trying to get better at that, Rob.</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>I'm asking you this because many people around the world throw away food that's still good enough to eat – this food waste could feed millions of other people. That's what we're talking about today as well as looking at some related vocabulary.</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>Yes, food waste is a big problem. We <strong>stock up</strong> <strong>on</strong> food that we don't really need, and we're often tempted by supermarkets to <strong>consume</strong> – or to eat – more.</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>Before we talk more about this, let's find out what you know about food waste. So, do you know, according to the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organisation, what percentage of food is actually wasted?</p><p>a) <strong>  </strong>25%</p><p>b)<strong>   </strong>33%</p><p>c)<strong>   </strong>50%</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>50%, I seem to remember that. I might be wrong.</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>We'll find out if you're right or wrong later on. But now, here's another figure for you: In Europe, people throw away 100 million tonnes of food every year.</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>Wow, such a waste. Most of this food just ends up rotting in <strong>landfill sites</strong> and that adds to another problem – it creates greenhouse gases.</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>It does. But the problem isn't just <em>us</em> throwing away <strong>leftovers </strong>in the fridge or cupboard, as we can hear now from BBC reporter Caroline Hepker. What are the other reasons that lead to food being wasted?  </p><p><strong>Caroline Hepker, BBC Reporter<br clear=""none""/></strong>Typically, supermarkets demand that onions are about two to two-and-a-quarter inches in diameter. This one will get pretty close to it but this one is too small, although it is perfectly edible. The question is, what happens to it then? Food waste is a huge issue in America – 40% of all food goes uneaten and it's a problem that starts long before you get to the dining-room table.</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>Another staggering figure there Rob – 40% of all food in America goes uneaten – it doesn't get eaten. And she explained that supermarkets are partly to blame.</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>Yes. We all love the <strong>convenience</strong>, the price and the choice of food that supermarkets offer – but a lot of food is binned – thrown out – long before it reaches the shelves.</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>The reporter gave the example of onions: if they're the wrong size, they can't be sold; they're thrown away even though they’re good enough to eat – or <strong>edible</strong>.</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>There are many other types of fruit and vegetables that are <strong>discarded</strong> – or thrown away – because of their shape and size. And that's our fault really, because we often think food that looks good is better quality.</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>Another issue is the 'sell by' and 'use by' dates printed on food packaging. They confuse customers. Anything older than the 'sell by' date makes us think it’s old and the food has <strong>gone off</strong>, but in fact this is just the date the supermarket wants to sell it by.</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>And there is another reason why some of us are encouraged to buy too much food. Have a listen to working mum, Tara Sherbrooke, about her shopping habits and see if you can hear what the problem is.</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>Also, see if you can hear what she does to try and minimise food waste.</p><p><strong>Tara Sherbrooke<br clear=""none""/></strong>I try very hard to meal-plan because as a working mum and having a busy family, I really try to make sure that there’s enough food at the beginning of the week. I find it very difficult to walk pass two-for-one offers especially on things that we use. I even find it hard to walk past them when they're items I’ve never purchased before – I stop and look!</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>So she is a busy working mum and she tries to meal-plan – she plans the family's meals for the week and works out what to buy.</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>But she still gets tempted by the two-for-one offers. That's when you buy one item and you get another one of the same item for free.</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>Buy-one-get-one-free – or as it's sometimes known, <strong>BOGOF</strong>! You can get a bargain but it also means we sometimes buy too much of something. If it's fresh produce, it might go off before you get to use it all.</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>But in other parts of the world people struggle to buy even the most basic food. A report by the UN's Food and Agricultural Organisation found that there is enough food for everyone, just a lot of inefficiency. So what can be done?</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>Well, things are being done. Apps and websites that <strong>distribute</strong> excess food are becoming more popular.</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>And food banks are being set up too. These are charitable organisations people donate food to. It's then distributed to those who have difficulty buying their own food. And one trial project in New York requires the city's restaurants to stop sending food waste to landfills by 2015. But at the moment, globally, there's still a lot of food being thrown away. And Finn, I asked you how much? Is it 25%, 33% or 50% of all food produced?</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>I said half – 50%.</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>According to the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organisation, the answer is 33%. Still not good. It also found the amount of land needed to grow all the food wasted in the world each year would be the size of Mexico. Well, that brings us to the end of today's 6 Minute English.

Welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm joined today by Finn. Hello Finn.</p><p><strong>Finn  </strong> ...</p><p><strong>Rob                 <br clear=""none""/></strong>Finn? …Hello Finn?</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>Oh sorry Rob, you caught me <strong>napping</strong>. It's that time of day when I need to <strong>nod off</strong> – or in other words, fall asleep.</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>Well, <strong>sleeping on the job</strong> – or sleeping at work - is no bad thing – and I hope today's programme will wake you up to the idea that sleeping in the workplace might be a good thing.</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>Oh really! That's good to hear. I would have thought that sleeping at work was against the rules.</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>Not in every office, Finn, and I'll tell you why soon as well as explaining some sleep-related vocabulary. But now you're wide awake, how about a question?</p><p><strong>Finn                 <br clear=""none""/></strong>OK, let's hear it.</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>When the former British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, was in power, she did her job with very little sleep. Do you know how many hours of sleep she is said to have had each night?</p><p>a)    Three hours</p><p>b)    Four hours</p><p>c)    Five hours</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>I always thought she got by, she managed her job, with just four hours of sleep a night.</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>Not much, is it? We'll find out if you are right or wrong later. I'm not sure if she chose <em>not</em> to sleep for long or she just wasn't able to sleep for long. Someone who can't sleep is called an <strong>insomniac</strong>.  </p><p><strong>Finn                 <br clear=""none""/></strong>And I'm certainly not an insomniac. I enjoy sleeping all night and some of the day too. And Rob, you said napping during the day is a good thing?</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>It's always nice to have a short sleep – or what I call <strong>40 winks</strong> – during the day, but when you're at work this can be a problem.  In some companies, like Google and the Huffington Post, workplace naps are positively encouraged. They're seen as a way to make staff more productive.</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>So you mean they work harder and are more creative because a <strong>power-nap</strong> – a quick sleep – makes workers feel refreshed and more alert. I like the sound of this!</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>An Australian health writer called Thea O'Connor, is a founder of a campaign called Nap Now which is trying to make sleeping at work more acceptable.  She calls herself a '<strong>naptivist</strong>'! Let's hear from her now. What does she say is stopping us from doing this?</p><p><strong>Thea O'Connor, health writer and speaker:  <br clear=""none""/></strong>I think that our culture is a bit crazy not to embrace it, and one of the reasons we don't is our attitude, you know it's quite counter-cultural to do nothing in order to get ahead. I just really see that it's time to disrupt the prevailing work ethic which is all about work longer and harder.</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>Right, so she wants us to embrace – to accept – the idea of a workplace power-nap. But it is our <strong>attitude</strong> – the way we think about work – that stops society from accepting this.</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>Yes, she explains that it is <strong>counter-cultural</strong> – so going against the normal way of thinking – to actually do nothing and have a snooze.</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>That's why she is trying to change – or disrupt – our current <strong>work ethic</strong> of working longer and harder. She believes this doesn't necessarily bring better results. But Rob, is this idea just a fad – something that's popular for a short while?</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>Maybe, but research has certainly shown that good quantity and quality of sleep is important for our <strong>wellbeing</strong>. A few years ago research by the East of England Development Agency found 30% of people have their best ideas in bed compared to just 11% who have them at their desk. It called for companies to install beds in the workplace.</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>Well, there aren't any in our office yet Rob. I think putting beds or areas for naps in the office would help us workers feel more able to rest and recharge our minds.</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>An alternative idea would be to change our working hours. The UK's Sleep Council claims the <strong>nine-to-five</strong> work culture does not fit into the natural sleeping pattern of the human race and bosses need to introduce a more sleep-friendly working day.</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>That sounds like a <strong>siesta</strong> to me - a short period of sleep in the middle of the day that people in warm places like Spain often have.</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>My problem with a siesta is that if I have a sleep in the afternoon I'd never wake up!</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>Well before you nod off now Rob, could you please tell me the answer to today's question.</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>Yes. I asked you if you knew how many hours of sleep the former British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, is said to have had each night?  Three, four or five hours?</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>I said four hours Rob.</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>You are right. It has often been said she needed just four hours of sleep – only on weekdays, not weekends. Well before you have another power-nap, could you remind us of some of the vocabulary we've heard today:</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>Yes, we heard:</p><p>napping</p><p>nod off</p><p>sleeping on the job</p><p>insomniac</p><p>40 winks</p><p>power-nap</p><p>naptivist</p><p>attitude</p><p>counter-cultural</p><p>work ethic</p><p>wellbeing</p><p>nine-to-five</p><p>siesta</p><p><strong>Rob<br clear=""none""/></strong>Thanks.

Welcome to 6 Minute English. And with me here in the studio ladies and gentlemen is … Finn!</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>Thank you! Thank you sound effects! Thank you, Neil! Is this all for me? I feel like quite a <strong>celebrity</strong>!               </p><p><strong>Neil<br clear=""none""/></strong>Yes, a celebrity – someone famous - particularly someone in <strong>show business</strong>, that's the world of entertainment, theatre and film. Today we're talking about fame, and teaching you some related vocabulary.</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>Yes. Some celebrities are famous for their<strong> talent</strong>, which means by their ability to do something well, like singing, acting or telling jokes …</p><p><strong>Neil<br clear=""none""/></strong>And others are famous for… well, for being famous or being associated with someone who is. The names Paris Hilton and Kim Kardashian come to mind: wealthy women with their own TV shows. But, talking about celebrity, let me ask you a question.</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>Actually Neil, only if you play that lovely applause again.  Go on Neil!</p><p><strong>Neil<br clear=""none""/></strong>I knew you would love this. Right. Here it goes.</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>Yes! Anyway, Neil... I can give you my <strong>autograph</strong> later…</p><p><strong>Neil<br clear=""none""/></strong>You mean signature? An autograph is the signature of a <em>famous</em> person, Finn. Fans collect these and things like photographs.</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>Yes, we call things like those <strong>memorabilia</strong>.<strong>       <br clear=""none""><br clear=""none""/></br></strong><strong>Neil<br clear=""none""/></strong>For example, Michael Jackson's leather glove with shiny crystals - it became very famous in the 1980s when he presented his moonwalk to the world. How much was it sold for at auction in 2009? Was it:</p><p>a)             US$ 150,000</p><p>b)             US$ 250,000 or</p><p>c)             US$ 350,000</p><p><strong><br clear=""none"">Finn<br clear=""none""/></br></strong>I think Michael Jackson has some big fans in the world so I'll say c) US$ 350,000.</p><p><strong>Neil<br clear=""none""/></strong>Okay. I'll give you the answer at the end of the programme.</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>So the idea of celebrity seems very modern in some ways – does it have a long history?</p><p><strong>Neil<br clear=""none""/></strong>Well, Lord Byron, a very famous English poet born in 1788, is considered by some experts to be the world's first modern-style celebrity. Let's hear Dr Corin Throsby, English Literature researcher at Cambridge University.</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>Why was Byron a celebrity?</p><p><strong>Neil<br clear=""none""/></strong>Listen out for the noun she uses in the first sentence meaning a product, or something for sale.</p><p><strong>INSERT<br clear=""none""/></strong><strong>Dr Corin Throsby, Cambridge University<br clear=""none""/></strong>If we think of celebrity as the moment where someone's personality becomes a <strong>commodity</strong>. So, for Byron the fact that he was popular on this scale that had never been achieved before because his career had coincided with mass printing. But something more than that, that there was a sort of a secondary industry of Byron stuff, you know, that there were Byron neck ties, people wanted to look like Byron. There was this mass of people that loved him. He could no longer control his <strong>image</strong>. I think that's what separates celebrity from the fame that had preceded that.</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>So the noun was 'a commodity'. She said that when someone's personality becomes a product, that's when they turn into a celebrity. <strong>          </strong></p><p><strong>Neil<br clear=""none""/></strong>She talked of fame so big you can't control your own image<strong> – </strong>that's your reputation, the way other people think about you and imagine you. Someone interesting in this respect is Justin Bieber.</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>Yeah. Are you a fan, Neil?</p><p><strong>Neil<br clear=""none""/></strong>I'm a massive fan of Justin Bieber. I love him.</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>I believe you.</p><p><strong>Neil<br clear=""none""/></strong>He's a big name and he's always in the newspapers. His fans are called 'Beliebers'…</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>and Byron's fans were called 'Byron maniacs'. That's the name his wife gave his adoring fans. Though she wasn't too happy about them.  </p><p><strong>Neil<br clear=""none""/></strong>Yes. Byron's life was full of <strong>scandals</strong>, actions which cause shock and disapproval among people.</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>And for Byron it was mainly his love life. He had affairs with men and women. </p><p><strong>Neil<br clear=""none""/></strong>For Justin Bieber it's about his behaviour. He was accused of driving after drinking alcohol, and of <strong>vandalism</strong>.</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>Vandalism means causing damage to property.</p><p><strong>Neil<br clear=""none""/></strong>Poor Justin Bieber!</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>Though he's very popular - his career started when he was in his early teens and I think it must have been difficult growing up with this global fame. Still, I wonder how much his autograph is worth in the current market…</p><p><strong>Neil<br clear=""none""/></strong>Well,I don't know about Justin Bieber's autograph but I do know about Michael Jackson's shiny glove. It became iconic in the 1980s, but how much was it sold for? Was it US$ 150,000; US$ 250,000 or c) US$ 350,000?</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>I said c) US$ 350,000.<strong>    </strong></p><p><strong>Neil<br clear=""none""/></strong>And you were right.</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>Wow! That's rare.</p><p><strong>Neil<br clear=""none""/></strong>Did you buy it?</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>It wasn't me. No.</p><p><strong>Neil<br clear=""none""/></strong>Well, our time's up but let's remember the words we heard from today. Finn.</p><p><strong>Finn<br clear=""none""/></strong>We heard:</p><p>celebrity</p><p>show business</p><p>talent</p><p>autograph</p><p>memorabilia</p><p>commodity</p><p>image</p><p>scandal</p><p>vandalism</p><p><strong>Neil<br clear=""none""/></strong>That's it for today.

You're not alone. Everyone from factory workers to pilots experience a feeling of boredom: feeling unhappy and uninterested in what they are doing. Some people get bored because they have nothing to do. But is it always a negative emotion or can it push you to do something different?, 140821 	 21 Aug 2014,"<p>Note: This is not a word for word transcript</p><p><strong>Rob</strong></p><p>Hello I'm Rob. Welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm joined today by Finn. Hello Finn.</p><p><strong>Finn</strong></p><p>Hi Rob. You know, I'm happy you called me to present this programme with you because I was there by my desk feeling a bit bored (yawns loudly).</p><p><strong>Rob</strong></p><p>Great yawn, Finn! A yawn, of course, is that typical reaction of someone who is bored.</p><p><strong>Finn</strong></p><p>Yeah, it's when you open your mouth wide and take some air in and slowly out.</p><p><strong>Rob</strong></p><p>Okay. Let's make this a programme all about boredom, shall we? And I'll start by stimulating your imagination.</p><p><strong>Finn</strong></p><p>Thank you, but how are you going to make me excited and interested in something, Rob?</p><p><strong>Rob</strong></p><p>How about I challenge you to a question you might not know the answer to?</p><p><strong>Finn</strong></p><p>Okay, well, you can try. Go on then.</p><p><strong>Rob</strong></p><p>Well, I know you like the theatre.</p><p><strong>Finn</strong></p><p>I do. But it has to be an exciting play or I get restless.</p><p><strong>Rob</strong></p><p>Restless, you mean unable to sit still because you get bored or worried even. Okay. I wonder how you'd feel watching the longest continuous play recorded?</p><p><strong>Finn</strong></p><p>That's quite an offer. What do you mean?</p><p><strong>Rob</strong></p><p>According to the Guinness Book of Records, the longest continuous dramatic performance was held in New Jersey, in the US, in 2010. But do you know how long the cast for The Bald Soprano by Eugene Ionesco, was on stage for? Was it for about:</p><p>a) 8 hours</p><p>b) 17 hours</p><p>c) 23 hours</p><p><strong>Finn</strong></p><p>Wow! They're all pretty long. I'll say b) 17 hours, Rob.</p><p><strong>Rob</strong></p><p>Goodness! Right. Okay. I'll let you know the answer by the end of the programme. Now, let's talk more about boredom. I think this is a feeling we have to learn how to cope with.</p><p><strong>Finn</strong></p><p>Yes, we have to learn to deal with this situation successfully – to cope with it. But people often feel they want to change their life, to change their job. They might feel stuck in a rut.</p><p><strong>Rob</strong></p><p>That's a good phrase - stuck in a rut. So you mean you've become too fixed in one kind of job?</p><p><strong>Finn</strong></p><p>Yes. You know Rob, even I sometimes dream of something a bit more exciting like being a professional diver or maybe even a pilot of a really fast plane.</p><p><strong>Rob</strong></p><p>Well, guess what: even pilots get bored, you know?</p><p><strong>Finn</strong></p><p>Not when they are flying anyway.</p><p><strong>Rob</strong></p><p>Wrong. When they're up in the air!</p><p><strong>Finn</strong></p><p>No way! Really? I don't believe you!</p><p><strong>Rob</strong></p><p>Well, Missy Cummings, an American, was a fighter pilot. Listen to the phrasal verb she uses meaning to stop being bored, at least for a while. Is there ever time for a fighter pilot to get bored?</p><p><strong>Missy Cummings, former fighter pilot:</strong></p><p>Oh my gosh, sure, for the same reasons that commercial pilots get bored. These fighter jets are very automated when it comes to just holding altitude and heading. So you turn everything in autopilot and I probably listened to more Oprah Winfrey TV shows on the high-frequency radios… And so you get good about using the technology to figure out how to stave off that boredom.</p><p><strong>Finn</strong></p><p>Ah, so she listened to a show hosted by the American presenter Oprah Winfrey on the radio to stave off her boredom. Now, to stave off means to stop or to keep an unpleasant feeling away. In this case she means boredom.</p><p><strong>Rob</strong></p><p>Yes, indeed.</p><p>But some experts think there's something good about feeling bored.</p><p><strong>Finn</strong></p><p>Really?</p><p><strong>Rob</strong></p><p>Let's hear what Tiffany Watt-Smith has to say. She works for the Centre for the History of Emotions at the Queen Mary University of London. Pay attention to the word she uses to describe what boredom does to people.</p><p><strong>Tiffany Watt-Smith, Queen Mary University of London:</strong></p><p>On the one hand people are worried about being under-occupied and bored. On the other there's a set of anxieties about us having any more downtime, you know. We can constantly check our phones at the bus stop. Everything is to be filled and what does that do to our minds? I think boredom is a very useful emotion. It's an emotion which spurs people on to change something about their environment. If you're bored that gives rise to creativity.</p><p><strong>Finn</strong></p><p>So boredom spurs people on to change something. To spur on means to stimulate or to encourage someone to do something.</p><p><strong>Rob</strong></p><p>So what are you going to do, Finn? How will you change your life?</p><p><strong>Finn</strong></p><p>Change my life? Okay. Two things. The first one is: I want to know if I got that question right!</p><p><strong>Rob</strong></p><p>Well I said at the beginning of the programme that the longest continuous dramatic performance was held in New Jersey, US, in 2010. And I asked you how long was the cast on stage for to play The Bald Soprano by Eugene Ionesco.</p><p><strong>Finn</strong></p><p>Yes. The options were 8 hours, 17 hours and 23 hours, I think. And I said 17. Was I right?</p><p><strong>Rob</strong></p><p>You were not!</p><p><strong>Finn</strong></p><p>Oh, no!</p><p><strong>Rob</strong></p><p>It was even longer.</p><p><strong>Finn</strong></p><p>Wow! 23!</p><p><strong>Rob</strong></p><p>According to the Guinness Book of Records, the play lasted 23 hours, 33 minutes and 54 seconds. It was achieved by The 27 O'Clock Players who performed The Bald Soprano at Belmar, New Jersey, USA, on 27 July 2010. Anyway Finn, what's the second thing you're going to do to stave off your boredom?</p><p><strong>Finn</strong></p><p>You know what, Rob? I'm going to book myself a fantastic holiday! Maybe I could start with a visit to Patagonia in Argentina to see the penguins…</p><p><strong>Rob</strong></p><p>Yeah, it sounds very exciting. But before you head off to Patagonia, could you remind us of some of the English words we've heard today?</p><p><strong>Finn</strong></p><p>We heard:</p><p>yawn</p><p>stimulating</p><p>restless</p><p>to cope with</p><p>stuck in a rut</p><p>to stave off</p><p>to spur on</p><p><strong>Rob</strong></p><p>Thanks Finn.
